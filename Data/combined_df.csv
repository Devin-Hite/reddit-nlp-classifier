The unsurprising final three shortlist and the deserving winner (Lewandowski) demonstrate that the jury selection process is nowhere near as corrupt or politicised, and is thus much more accurate.

Meanwhile, virtually every South American jury voter for the Ballon D‚Äôor boycotted Lewandowski by not including him in their top 5 at all. This, as well as the Ballon D‚Äôor failing to retrospectively award Lewandowski for 2020, despite the year of football still being played and Lewandowski winning all he could have won (top goal scorer, treble etc.), has caused significant disrepute to France Football in the eyes of many.

As it stands, the Ballon D‚Äôor is no longer reflective of the reality of the game played today and of the thoughtful opinions of serious football fans worldwide. Unless the voting (or jury selection) process changes and Lewandowski is redressed, I think we will see many start to boycott the event.",1642464282

65,soccer,"real madrid chews gum, raises its eyebrow, and lifts the trophy","**Real Madrid chews gum, raises its eyebrow, and lifts the trophy**

In a match which started tepidly and finished furiously, Real Madrid claimed its twelfth Supercup title. Athletic Club team was hopeful to lift the cup again twelve months later, but was unable to do what is currently needed to unsettle Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs team.

As the news pre-match developed through the weekend, those watching enjoyed a sweet moment between managers Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelino Garcia Toral. The manager from Asturias shared with Ancelotti a photo of a 1987 match in which, for a little under ten minutes, both shared the pitch in a UEFA Cup (now Europa League) match in Gijon.

Sporting Gijon measured up against none other than AC Milan, and what‚Äôs more, bested the Italian side, 1-0. 16,000 Sporting fans watched as its team put one over van Basten, Tassotti, Gullit and company. The second leg was sealed with a 3-0 win by AC Milan. Ultimately, the Asturianos could not hold Arrigo Sacchi‚Äôs side.¬†

On Sunday‚Äôs match to determine the winner between Blancos and Leones, the same expected result followed. The team favorite to win did so, and in a moment worthy of mention ‚Äìespecially these days‚Äì both Marcelino and Ancelotti hugged and smiled at each other at the end of it, recognizing the opposition‚Äôs effort.¬†

The match itself was not one to necessarily keep in your shortlist of matches of the season. Athletic Club set up with its usual 4-4-2, attempting to pressure up the field and not allowing Real Madrid to build from the back. When Real managed to do so, Marcelino kept two tight lines, ready to retrieve the ball and feed I√±aki Williams for the quick counter.¬†

Los Blancos showed the quality they have honed through the season to absorb that pressure, including Courtois as they passed through the first line and enjoyed the resulting space after that. In the few times Athletic armed a counter, Alaba particularly showed too strong and sharp for the older of the Williams brothers.

Through the first half, Athletic kept Real Madrid tamed, De Marcos and Berenguer more preoccupied in holding Vinicius than projecting up the pitch, and as a result, pushing Real to move on the right side. Rodrygo had more freedom than Vini last night, and Ancelotti‚Äôs team initially suffered through it, as the right winger is not as dangerous and positively chaotic as Vinicius.¬†

The crowd did not mind watching a slow first half. A sold-out King Fahd Stadium hosted 30,000 fans as they cheered ‚Äìunanimously for Real Madrid‚Äì and in one of those moments that only happens when neutral fans are present, inexplicably doing the wave with a scoreline of 0-0. Internationally-held Super Cup things.¬†

A few minutes after the wave, the score did change. Modric enabled Rodrygo on the right, with the Brazilian pushing the rival defense back with an incisive run, and passing back to the Croatian, who, on the inside edge of the box, released a Kroos-style curved shot into Unai Simon‚Äôs top left corner.¬†

A beautiful goal for Luka Modric who, at 36, continued to advocate for more playing time at the top level, and claimed his first goal of the season in the best possible scenario so far this season for Real Madrid.

Ultimately, Athletic paid for pressuring so high up the pitch when the opposition‚Äôs defense had the ball, and left a gap on midfield which Rodrygo and Modric took advantage of. The last few minutes of the first half ended with a close shot by Sancet, but overall, it left Marcelino leaving the bulk of the work to the second half.¬†

The manager took a page from the semifinal‚Äôs book, and put Nico Williams on to the pitch in the second half. The 19 year old was poised to revolutionize the match, as he had done against Atletico de Madrid, but the rival defense was on point against the young player, and overall, Athletic‚Äôs attack through the first hour of play.¬†

Real Madrid‚Äôs back four, and regardless of who is on the right ‚ÄìLucas Vazquez yesterday, as Carvajal was out with due to COVID‚Äì is extremely strong when Alaba, Militao, and Mendy are all in. The Brazilian center-back is especially reliable when Alaba is on the pitch with him; one of those cases of center backs made better by their teammate. Varane-Ramos. Albiol-Pau.¬†

Ten minutes into the first half, controversy was served when a potential handball inside of the box by Alaba meant VAR had to show the referee what had happened in slow motion (as per the book, it wasn‚Äôt a penalty). Five minutes into the second half, another handball was reviewed by the referee via the camera, but this one was to be called ‚ÄìBenzema‚Äôs shot hit Yeray‚Äôs stretched-out arm‚Äì and was executed by the French striker.¬†

Well-placed shot by Benzema, right of the goalkeeper, to which Unai Simon did not respond fast enough. The striker celebrated the second goal, and the goalkeeper smashed his bottle of water against the turf. Things were going exactly as Ancelotti wanted them to go, regardless of the way they played, and to whether they played to counter or keep possession.

The score read 2-0, and Marcelino made adjustments accordingly. Three changes, including Raul Garcia, meant Athletic had new blood on the pitch, and Real Madrid had to get Valverde out to counter that energy. The Uruguayan did wonders for Real and showed to be sharp and hungry for the ball. Modric and Kroos channeled their quality with the ball as they transitioned from defense to attack. Behind them, Casemiro played arguably his best match this month. But Athletic was getting closer.¬†

Ancelotti, on the sideline, fully accepted the situation as he often does. He saw the last 30 minutes as time for his team to not get overly tired and protect the win. Time went by as Raul Garcia, Muniain and the Williams brothers tried, to no avail.¬†

The dam broke in the last ten minutes, and the crowd was given a fitting finale to their week. Nico Williams orchestrated his first play worthy of mention, and almost connected with Raul Garcia. Marcelo came out to claim a place on the pitch, and contribute to what would be his 23rd trophy in all competitions with Real Madrid, tying him as a record-man with legendary player Paco Gento. And in a moment that left a lot of us scratching our heads, a shot impacted with Militao‚Äôs hand ‚Äì-not that uncommon‚Äì, and the referee, deeming it a clear scoring opportunity, showed the Brazilian the red card ‚Äìthis *was* surprising‚Äì. A chance for Athletic.

Everyone made plans for what the next few minutes of the match would look like, with Real Madrid ahead but with one less player. Courtois had other plans. The 6 7‚Äô‚Äô (201 cm) goalkeeper managed to save Raul Garcia‚Äôs penalty kick. Diving to his right, the Belgian kept his Cruyff-esque long legs close enough to the center of the goal to pull an acrobatic save that should be made into a poster by someone somewhere.¬†

That was the end of it. Marcelino put his head down, and Athletic with him. Real had done all the right things to lift the trophy, and the Basques, simply not enough to retain it. With a full sprint by Luke Modric in the 92nd minute to retrieve the ball as one of the last highlights, the match ended, and with it, started the celebrations.¬†

Marcelo, captain‚Äôs armband and trophy aimed at the sky, watched with his team as the confetti fell. Luka Modric was named man of the match, and Ancelotti was clear about the value of the Croatian in this team. ‚ÄúLuka‚Äôs form is deserving of a second Ballon d‚ÄôOr.‚Äù¬†

He also had words for the group as a whole as it claimed the first trophy of the season, the only one Ancelotti was missing in Spain; ‚ÄúWhen you win, you think you are the best, the most handsome. These players don‚Äôt believe any of that‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are not handsome, either,‚Äù he joked.¬†

Neither was the win, but with a practical, defensive at times and explosive at others, and in very Ancelotti fashion, Real Madrid chewed gum, raised its eyebrow, and lifted the trophy.¬†

You could do it the exact same way you do the current world cup, and it could happen every 4th summer, kind of like the nation's world cup, but on an off year. (Not a world cup or Olympics year). Even the amount of representation per subsidiary could be the same as the world cup.

Cooper is the only member of our defence to have played at least 75% of games, and he will be out until March. Also of our 6 relatively healthy players, half are wingers. It's been a fairly underwhelming season for Leeds compared to last year, but when you put into perspective how many different lineups and combinations have had to be used, 2 points off 11th is a fantastic achievement",1642422725

666,soccer,to clarify: halaand has no release clause. but there is most likely a gentlemen's agreement between him and borussia dortmund.,"The majority of people still think that Halaand has a release clause in his contract for summer 2022. 

That's not the case.  BVB CEO Watzke already denied the existence of a release clause for Halaands contract for the summer 2022. 

He said that during the annual shareholder meeting in december.

Source: [https://www.sport.de/news/ne4720744/bvb-watzke-dementiert-ausstiegsklausel-bei-erling-haaland/](https://www.sport.de/news/ne4720744/bvb-watzke-dementiert-ausstiegsklausel-bei-erling-haaland/)

We do not know the exact details about his contract. But it isn't far-fetched that Dortmund has a bit more say than people are believing about halaands contract. Maybe Haaland has to stay if Dortmund offers a certain salary (Dortmund invest in their squad in this winter which was a surprise by many).

But that's just speculation. Why do people believe Haaland can leave for 75-90M?",1642346891

This seemed like a somewhat misleading stat to me, because Beckham played a little more than twice as many minutes in the Premier League than Ward-Prowse has.

Ward-Prowse scores on a free kick every 1592 minutes played, while Beckham scored every 2291 minutes played. So, Ward-Prowse's free kick rate is 36% faster than Beckham's.

This made me wonder whether there are stats available on free kick attempts and goals. Did Beckham take twice as many free kicks as Ward-Prowse has?",1642296096

1786,soccer,new study: long covid impact in bundesliga,"Team, 

There was a great read in latest Economist magazine on the long-term impact of covid infection of professional football players across Europe. Study is purely data driven and done by renown scientists. 

Take-aways: 
- even after full recovery, players do worse on a number of performance statistics. 

- this is a broad based trend, observable across many datapoints. 

- players played less minutes, still significantly lower 6 months following the infection. Also completed less passes and scored worse on more comprehensive measures of performance. 

My thoughts: 
If pro players with amazing access to health care suffer longterm consequences, this is quite a sobering outlook. I expect more of this data to appear the next months and years. 

Let‚Äôs hope our clubs, players and societies overall stay safe!

2,nba,"tobias harris is one of the worst playoff performers in the league, and it isn't talked about enough","Everytime the Sixers have genuinely needed Tobias in the playoffs, he's fallen hilariously short of expectations, and it seems to get worse every year.  


[Sixers vs Raptors Series Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-76ers-vs-raptors.html)

In the 2019 second round against the Raptors, Harris averaged 14 on 38/28 splits for the series, he had the WORST offensive rating among all Sixers players who actually played proper minutes that series.  


[Sixers vs Celtics Series Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2020-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-76ers-vs-celtics.html)

In the 2020 first round, with Ben Simmons injured and Embiid desperately in need of Harris to step up against Boston, he responded by shooting 23/60 from the field, which included being 2/15 from the 3 point line. He didn't even make a 3-pointer until game 4 when the Sixers were already down 3-0.  


[Sixers vs Hawks Series Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2021-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-hawks-vs-76ers.html)

In the 2021 second round series vs Atlanta, Harris was nowhere, he provided none of the spacing the Sixers actually needed with his reluctance to shoot any 3 pointer that wasnt completely wide open and created by a teammate, only once did he attempt more than 4 threes in the entire series.  


Tobias' worst performance in this series though came during the important 4th quarters, in the Sixers  4 losses to Atlanta, Harris scored 2, 0, 0, and 7 points in the four 4th quarters, a total of 9 points in 4 games the sixers lost by a COMBINED 17 points. For reference, Ben Simmons scored 10 points across those four 4th quarters.

9,nba,when do nba refs call travels? is it better to remove the travelling rule altogether?,"In recent years, it seems that movement that seems like travelling don't result in calls. Stuff like Harden's stepbacks, Kawhi's ""The Shot"" and many transition dunks have people wondering what counts as a travel anymore. People say that these moves are okay because of a gather step, but are the refs too willing to let these moves pass? Considering transition plays are some of the most exciting parts of basketball, would it be better for there to be less need to worry about travelling? What would the league look like if players were allowed to travel? It might be more exciting watching a player run from one end to the other for a dunk.",1642473316

&gt; ""I owed him, actually, because my rookie year I tried to dunk on him and it didn't go so well. He came up to me after, I told him that and he told me if I did that again he would punch me in the face. I owed him, for sure,"" Kuzma said.

&gt;As questions about the play kept coming from reporters during his postgame press conference, Kuzma decided to downplay it a bit.

&gt;‚ÄùI mean, it wasn't that nasty, honestly. I dunked on him. It wasn't that spectacular. I'm half-white, so I didn't get up that high. I'm just glad I got there,"" he joked.

He's gotten an increased role with COVID protocols taking Beal out of the lineup, and he's responded well. I see a lot of people saying his counting stats are near identical to last year, but I don't think he's ever had a stretch this good in his career. Lakers fans, feel free to say otherwise as I didn't watch him much in his early career. 

For the season, Kuzma is averaging 16/9/3 on 45/32/69 splits",1642473061

36,nba,"45 games into the season, the cavaliers, a team who won 20 games last year; have a better record than the defending champions milwaukee bucks.","The Cavaliers are currently 27-18, the Bucks are currently 27-19.

The Cavs resurgence is in large part due to Garland‚Äôs jump from a mediocre point guard to all star, Evan Mobley being a defensive juggernaut in his rookie season, Kevin Love becoming one of the most productive bench players in the league, and Jarrett Allen continuing to improve and possibly being an all star this year. Bickerstaff has made the Cavs into one of the scarier defensive teams in basketball.

The Bucks have sustained injuries and they‚Äôve been slightly disappointing in the regular season, but in my opinion, this says more about the Cavaliers than the Bucks. 

Sources: https://www.espn.com/nba/standings",1642470649
37,nba,the 11 seed knicks have just 5 fewer wins than the 1st seed in the east. the 3 seed jazz have 4 fewer wins that the 1st seed in the west.,"Bonus fact; the 7th seeded Hornets are closer to 1st in their conference than the 3rd seeded Jazz.  
  
This Covid interrupted season has been unlucky any other we've ever seen. Even last year didn't have this many outs and teams crippled by the situation. As a result we have seen some wild quirks in the standings and at the moment the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5th seeds in the East are all equal on wins.  
  
It's really quite remarkable to see such a congested standings. The next closest I can remember is 2015-16 or 2016-17 when the 3-6 seeds in the East all had the same record.",1642470517
38,nba,the cavs are currently tied for most wins in the east and are only 1.5 games back of first place,"There is actually a five way tie for most wins in the East between the Bulls, Heat, Nets, Cavs, and Bucks.  The Cavs are in the 4 spot at the moment having a couple more losses than the Nets, Heat, and Bulls.",1642470444
39,nba,the milwaukee bucks are 2-6 in their last 8 games with wins against golden state and brooklyn.,"What a strange run for the Bucks who really asserted their dominance with a record breaking first half against Golden State but they have been truly slumping badly recently.  
  
The losses in this stretch happened at the hands of Detroit, Atlanta, Charlotte twice and Toronto twice. I don't know what to make of this and I know Jrue Holiday is a big out but surely Giannis and Khris should be able to do better. I currently have Giannis as the MVP front runner but if Milwaukee keep dropping these seriously winnable games he might not have the record for it.",1642470104

Seems like we've had dance cams, cheerleaders, t-shirt tosses at least from the 2010s (I started watching in 2009). And there's also the Mascot shenanigans, the trampoline dunks, fan make-a-shot challenges.  The different fan cams (staring contest, dance cam, fortnite dance cams).

Doc Rivers is at 1,017 wins currently, and has 98 playoff wins, totaling 1,115 total wins.

Therefore, Pop would have appx 400 more wins than doc after this season. Not even counting potential playoff wins, Doc would need to win just 55% of appx 727 more games to eclipse Pop. Therefore, Doc would need to last 9 more seasons in the NBA at that rate.

Does anyone think Doc can manage that? If so, that would be pretty wild. I think he's by far the most overrated coach in NBA history.

There‚Äôs a narrative going around saying that LeBron doesn‚Äôt make his teammates better and they usually become better when they‚Äôre off his team. 

Kevin Love, played bad on the Cavaliers, but now he‚Äôs having a bounce back year with LeBron obviously not being on the team

Jae crowder was mediocre on the Cavaliers in 2018, but now is one of the key pieces on the Suns and is a better shooter from when he was on the Cavs.


Kyle Kuzma was one of the biggest scapegoats on the Lakers being trashed by Laker fans every night, just to be traded to the Wizards and currently playing the best he‚Äôs played.


Jordan Clarkson left the Cavs and became one of the best 6 man players in the league.

Brandon Ingram left the Lakers and became a 25+ PPG scorer in his first season on the Pelicans.

And there‚Äôs probably a lot more you can name. So the question still stands, does LeBron James actually make his teammates better?

&gt; Winning without Simmons certainly makes it easier for Embid to adopt that
&gt; stance..and Philadelphia will be going for its 11th victory in 13 games Monday
&gt; afternoon at Washington on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Perhaps he has also
&gt; been sold on a concept that executives with a growing number of rival teams say
&gt; they see as Morey's new preferred scenario: Keeping Simmons beyond the trade
&gt; deadline to exhaust every last possibility for executing a complicated sign-and-
&gt; trade in the offseason that finally brings James Harden to Philadelphia and
&gt; routes Simmons to Brooklyn.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Complicated is a polite description for such a deal, since the Sixers would be
&gt; hard-capped by taking Harden in via sign-and-trade and would thus have to
&gt; shed more salary than just Simmons' contract according to the league's luxury-
&gt; tax rules to make it work financially. Yet it must be noted that there is enough
&gt; noise circulating leaguewide about Harden's reported openness to relocation

Marc Stein is a credible reporter and the fact that this news is out there means that perhaps Harden isn‚Äôt as committed to the Nets long term as initially expected.

LeBron has long since left Cleveland, but the team still is on the hook for Love‚Äôs contract.

A different example is the Nets signing old DeAndre Jordan to a 4-year deal to keep Durant and Irving company even though they already had young inexpensive Jarret Allen at center.

What other bad transactions have teams made to appease their star player?",1642450192

244,nba,if giannis wins mvp this year...,"How many better 4-year stretches would we have ever seen in the NBA?

3 MVPs

Finals MVP

DPOY

1 Championship

(probably) 4 \* All NBA 1st Team

(probably) 4 \* All Defensive Team

4 \* All Star

&amp;#x200B;

I know the MVP race is wide open and its possible that Embiid, Jokic, Steph, LeBron, or a number of other players could get hot and grab the lead, but it seems to me that Giannis is the current front-runner. 

Even if Giannis and the Bucks don't repeat, I'm not sure how many more dominant stretches we've ever seen. This very well may not be Giannis' ""peak"" but how many players have had better peaks than this? What are other dominant 3-4 year stretches that are as impressive?

I also find it crazy that despite the fact that this is relatively likely to happen, we don't (or can't) acknowledge that Giannis is the undisputed best player in the world. 

Perhaps it shows how much talent we have in the league, or perhaps it shows some bias we have against Giannis, but to me it still feels like you can argue that Jokic, KD, LeBron, and perhaps even Kawhi are the best player in the world. Of course, with the way Steph was playing last year, I would 100% include him in the convo too, but I'm not really sure what's going on with him this year. 

Thoughts on this? I feel like if a player wins 3 MVPs in 4 years, there should be minimal debate.",1642448977

&gt; In the 2021-22 season, Embiid is averaging a career-high 4.3 assists as he is seeing defenses better and he is making strides in that area. He is only getting better in that area of his game and that is something that has been impressive about him.

&gt;‚ÄùDouble teams, when I first got here it‚Äôs all I heard, ‚ÄòJoel and double teams‚Äô and we‚Äôve had no issues with it, but you‚Äôre gonna have a game here and there where it‚Äôs gonna affect you and you go back to the lab,‚Äù said Rivers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just part of it. He‚Äôs a willing worker, he cooperates, so for me, it‚Äôs been great.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really good,‚Äù Rivers added. ‚ÄúNo, really, and I say that half-jokingly, but it‚Äôs amazing how many calls I get from Kevin Garnett, ex-players, and we‚Äôre talking and I just say ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs good, man.

&gt;In this current season, Embiid has shown off more patience and he is really taking steps forward in terms of really controlling the game and understanding what has to be done in order to take steps forward as a more complete player.

&gt;‚ÄùFinally this year, he is baiting people,‚Äù Rivers finished. ‚Äò‚ÄùIt‚Äôs just been great to see. I think what he is finding and our sell to him is that you will be more efficient because people, they will hesitate before they come to get you.‚Äù",1642443897

So I'll admit...basketball isn't one of the sports I usually watch, although I might watch it every now and again and I know a bit about the history of the NBA (but not all that much). I've read in more than a few places that the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird rivalry during the 1980s revitalized the NBA, and then Michael Jordan took the league's popularity to all-new heights during the 1990s.

That said, I have a few questions for you:

1) What was so wrong with the NBA in the 1970s that the league needed to be revitalized during the 1980s?

2) How did the Magic-Bird rivalry revitalize the NBA during the 1980s?

3) I understand that the Lakers and Celtics had a rivalry during the 1960s as well, with Bill Russell starring for the Celtics and Wilt Chamberlain for the Lakers. Was there ever a Russell-Wilt rivalry? Was it bigger than Magic-Bird, and did it have the same impact on the NBA that Magic-Bird had? Why or why not? I seem to think that this rivalry (if it ever existed) is less well-remembered than Magic-Bird.

339,nba,"r/nba: who could dallas pursuit in a trade, seemingly escaping the mavs fandom's attention so far?","Everyone talks about H. Barnes, J. Grant or M. Turner and sometimes Dallas is mentioned with those names, but neither would realistically get Dallas into the contender tier, so overpaying would probably turn into a self-inflicted wound, because the Mavs likely have only one shot left at getting the right player via trade.

There is a quite consistently agreed upon opinion, that the Mavs need a wing player with roughly this profile (if they want to be real contenders this season or soon thereafter): 

Someone who can dribble/drive, create for himself and (as a secondary playmaker) others, scores at least around 20 ppg and plays at least some, preferably even good defense .

Dallas is not totally bereft of assets, but still limited in what they could/should offer. They have (for all intents and purposes) 1sts in 2025 and 2027, lots of pick swaps &amp; 2nd round picks plus Josh Green, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber as clearly positive assets.

E.g. my mind always wanders to Siakam, but I can't see Toronto giving him away. Ingram seems completely unrealistic right now.

So hive mind of r/nba: Who is possibly/realistically out there for a fine, but not great trade package? Someone on your team who (surprisingly) might be more available than one would think?",1642433478
340,nba,how would the best starting lineup today fare against an all-time nba team?,"The game has evolved so much since its humble beginnings, with players being paid more than ever before, equipped with the world's best nutritionists, trainers and coaching team, would it be a stretch to suggest that the best possible nba lineup of today could hold its own against an all-time lineup?

Here, we consider the peaks of the current crop of players against the peak 

**Current Lineup**   
2021 Steph  
2018 KD  
2013 Lebron  
2020 Giannis  
2022 Jokic

**All-time Lineup**  
1987 Magic  
1992 MJ  
1988 Larry Bird  
2004 Kevin Garnett  
2000 Shaq

It was really tough to come up with a best starting lineup of current players and even tougher to decide who makes the cut in the all-time lineup. But over here, apart from individual prowess, their abilities to elevate each other's games and cover for each other's shortcomings are considered. For the current lineup, the most glaring pick would be KD at the 2 to accommodate for Lebron at the 3. KD's length, versatility and efficiency would mean he has no problems slotting in at the 2, considering he used to play that position back at the Supersonics. Also, the current crop of players seem to be lacking an all-time level shooting guard outside of Klay and Harden, both of whom were left off the team in favour of KD and Lebron. The only other point guard who I even gave a sliver of consideration to was CP3, a traditional point guard reminiscent of those in the 90s and early 2000s. But ultimately, it would be a travesty to leave off Curry, the main dilemma here being choosing 2016 or 2021 Steph. Undoubtedly, unanimous MVP Curry was insane in terms of scoring and efficiency, but the 2021 version had a certain poise and swagger about him, despite being defended much tighter and having less spacing in his team. 2021 Curry was also more experienced and crafty, and of course his defense is also better than ever before, having put in the work in the gym. 2021 Curry would be more physically suitable for a game against the all-time greats. Other current players that garnered some consideration would be Kawhi, AD and Embiid. But just look at this lineup of Jokic, Giannis and Lebron at the frontcourt. The combined basketball IQ of these players and their ability to elevate each other's games would be amazing to watch. Curry is, without question, one of the best players off the ball and the best shooter of all time. Couple him with KD at the perimeter and constant attention will be needed on the two of them at the perimeter. This would be a dream for Lebron, where he is afforded the spacing as well as passing outlets to showcase his all-around game. With Giannis being an all-time level defender and Jokic's improved defense, this team would make it extremely tough for the all-time team.

There's almost no explanation needed here for the trio of Magic, Bird and MJ, who, arguably, brought NBA to global attention in the 80s and 90s on their backs. As for the power forward and centre positions, I personally think that KG is the best power forward here, considering the fit and that Tim Duncan played most of his games as a centre. KG was brilliant on the ball and could create for himself. He was also an excellent defender and could probably go toe-to-toe with Giannis. The toughest position to fill here would be the center, with an abundance of dominant post players in the past in Kareem, Hakeem and Shaq, just to name a few. I chose to go with Shaq here for his stretch of offensive dominance in the late 90s to early 2000s, where he would absolutely pummel anyone in his way. He was absolutely unstoppable and slotting this beast here would make this team downright disgusting. 

In a 7 game series today, it would be hard to predict which team comes out on top. It would be interesting to see how Magic would deal with Steph, and how KD would fare against MJ. All of these matchups will probably be extremely close and a 7-game series would probably go down to the coaching and how these players gel together. In my humble opinion, I'd go with the current team in 7 games, would love to know what you guys think!",1642433388

344,nba,nba week 13 donuts: the battle of jericho (sims),"In a desire for engagement, I'm going to include a title alongside my donuts now. 

Quick reminder, NBA Donuts tracks many of the major categories of the NBA, following people who have yet to register any of each stat. For example, Jay Huff has played 20 minutes and not scored a single field goal this year. That leads the NBA.

**Field Goals:**

By Minutes: Jay Huff (20 minutes) (NO CHANGE) 

By Attempts: Jaylen Morris, Jordan Schakel (6 FGA) (Down 1 attempt) (TEN DAY x2)

Marko Simonovic converted a very high percentage play into 2022‚Äôs first field goal.

[https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGM&amp;GameID=0022100625&amp;PlayerID=1630250&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGM&amp;GameID=0022100625&amp;PlayerID=1630250&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game)

He got some run only because of a blowout loss by the suddenly moribund Bulls, and added 8 more blowout points in the next game. A strong performance by Marko comes to a close for this year ‚Äì he hasn‚Äôt shown enough to get much of a role in the league for next year and may well end up on this list again in 2022-2023.

Jaylen Morris is such an unknown that his Wikipedia NBA career stats do not reflect his 2022 ten-day contract with the Spurs. Jordan Schakel is such an unknown that he does not even have an NBA career stats page on his Wikipedia page at all. That said, I‚Äôm sure somebody out there loves Jordan, and this is why:

‚ÄúIn 14 games,he averaged 13.8 points and 3.2 rebounds per game while shooting .396 from three-point range. He led the NBA G League in made threes during that stretch with 44.‚Äù

Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, is going to come up with Jordan Schakel G-League fun facts unless they really care. That has to feel nice for Mr. Schakel.

**3 Point Field Goals:**

By Minutes: Rudy Gobert (1222 minutes) (up 35 minutes)

By Attempts: Charlie Brown Jr. (9 attempts) (up 2 attempts) (TEN DAY)

Gobert wasn‚Äôt playing for a stretch, which gave Clint Capela a chance to take a run at the king. However, Capela himself has been nursing an ankle sprain, so he hasn‚Äôt been accumulating minutes in weeks. There are now 5 people with over 1000 minutes of no 3s. Maybe this will be more of a race than I thought.

Charlie Brown Jr. is in the middle of a second ten-day with the 76ers and he and Ben Simmons are currently tied for 3s made this year. (I‚Äôm not sure why I chose Simmons slander today.) Hopefully he gets a contract this season and it isn‚Äôt pulled out from under him. As you may not now, G-Leaguers make peanuts. 

**Free Throws:**

By Minutes: Denzel Valentine (222 minutes) (up 18 minutes)

By Attempts: Cat Barber (4 attempts) (NO CHANGE) (TEN DAY)

Denzel caught on with the Jazz, which I find somewhat inexplicable. I guess they need a warm body? He played 17 minutes against his former team, in a loss (and it wasn‚Äôt close). Having Valentine on your team is a surefire recipe for heartbreak. 

**Missed Field Goals (min attempts 1):**

By Minutes: Quinndary Weathersppon (16 minutes) (down 65 minutes) (TEN DAY)

By Attempts: Quinndary Weathersp0on (4 attempts) (down 2 attempts) (TEN DAY)

The Walls of Jericho have, at long last, come tumbling down. It‚Äôs a heartbreaker. It happened on January 12, against the Mavs.

[https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022100622&amp;PlayerID=1630579&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;GameID=0022100622&amp;PlayerID=1630579&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game)

Marquese Chriss guards him, and gets Sims to miss not 1 but 2 shots from within 1 foot. Pretty deflating way to leave the list, and I personally and going to stop my push to get him voted into the All-Star Game now.

Slotting in as the new leader is Quinndary Weatherspoon, which is a fabulous, fabulous name. Quinndary Weatherspoon treated the SEC like Widgets International, slowly rising through the ranks (All-SEC Freshman First Team, 2x All-SEC Second Team, All-SEC First Team as a senior) to become one of the premier scorers in the conference. After being upset by Liberty in the first round of the 2019 tournament, Spoonman was drafted by Spurs. He never really caught on, and ended up on a couple ten days from the Warriors.

**Missed Three Pointers (min attempts 1):**

By Minutes: Tristan Thompson (455 minutes, 1 attempt) (NO CHANGE)

By Attempts: three people (1 attempt) (NO CHANGE)

The entire list of people who have yet to miss a three while making at least one:

Tristan Thompson (455 minutes, 1 attempt)  
 Yves Pons (21 minutes, 1 attempt)  
 Robert Woodard II (15 minutes, 1 attempt)

The category last year had only 3 attempts as well, split among only 2 people. This category might just be sort of dead. We‚Äôll see ‚Äì I‚Äôm taking it under advisement.

**Missed Free Throws (min attempts 1):**

By Minutes: Avery Bradley (830 minutes, 9 attempts) (down 177 minutes)

By Attempts: Tre Jones (21 attempts) (NO CHANGE)

Covington goes down with a pair of missed free throws against the Nuggs. Not a great look, but they lost by like 50 so it didn‚Äôt matter in the end. Tre Jones didn‚Äôt attempt a free thrown, but neither did Frank, so that tight race remains unchanged.

**Offensive Rebounds:**

By Minutes: Markus Howard (116 minutes) (NO CHANGE)

This category has not changed in a very, very long time.

**Defensive Rebounds:**

By Minutes: Craig Sword (19 minutes) (NO CHANGE)

I think this is the first time where neither offensive nor defensive rebound donuts changed at all.

**Assists:**

By Minutes: Moses Brown (165 minutes) (up 3 minutes)

Moses had 3 charity-free minutes to play with last week.

\*ZEKE NNAJI CORNER\*

Nnaji played 67 minutes last week and, again, was not interested in getting any more assists.

His assist of the year remains this one:

[https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=AST&amp;GameID=0022100411&amp;PlayerID=1630192&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=1&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game&amp;CF=p\*E\*4](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=AST&amp;GameID=0022100411&amp;PlayerID=1630192&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=&amp;flag=1&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game&amp;CF=p*E*4)

Look at this game log:

[**https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nnajize01/gamelog/2022**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nnajize01/gamelog/2022)

If you re-started Nnaji‚Äôs season after his last assist, he‚Äôs back up 140 minutes without a single one. He‚Äôd be second on the list again! This is getting a little ridiculous, Zeke. Pass the goddamn ball!

**Steals:**

By Minutes: Isaiah Thomas (114 minutes) (NO CHANGE) (TEN DAY)

No movement on this at all.

**Blocks:**

By Minutes: D.J. Augustin (446 minutes) (up 46 minutes)

Tre didn‚Äôt play, and D.J. did. He kept himself clean and made a decent amount of hay here. 

**Turnovers:**

By Minutes: B.J. Johnson, Joe Wieskamp (65 minutes) (down 73 minutes) (TEN DAY)

Matt Thomas gives up the ghost. Joe Wieskamp makes an appearance in his second category (over the year ‚Äì he briefly held the defensive rebounds donut). Malcolm Hill is just a minute behind, as well.

**Personal Fouls:**

By Minutes: Carlik Jones (23 minutes) (NO CHANGE) (TEN DAY)

**Club Trillion Leader:**

Arnoldas Kulboka, Jaime Echenique (3 minutes, no FGA/FTA/REB/AST/STL/BLK/TOV/PF) (NO CHANGE)

377,nba,lebron defence - is anyone getting frustrated that he doesn‚Äôt shoulder the blame on these losses?,"Is anyone else getting frustrated with Lebron‚Äôs lack of effort? His body language is awful. Doesn‚Äôt switch or show any effort on most plays. He‚Äôs been like this for a long time. Other than when Vogal first came in and when the lakers went in the bubble where he played like he actually wanted to stop people. 

Russ is Russ. Why Lebron and AD signed off on him in the first place I‚Äôll never understand but when I watched The lakers lose to the Kings and Grizzlies I have to put a lot of the blame on Lebron. Against the Kings the team were rolling and up 14. He comes on and shoots 2 contested low % 3‚Äôs and a fadeaway. None close to scoring and the kings get the lead down to 6 (attacking him in the paint). Then 3rd quarter he just chucked up a load of 3‚Äôs. Lebron‚Äôs BBIQ is high enough to know he‚Äôs taking a gamble playing like that. 

I remember watching the cavs getting blown out by 20/30 regularly after they traded Irving and before they shipped Isiah/Crowder/dwade/rose etc. out. And he just didn‚Äôt show any effort. People said it‚Äôs because he was in his 15th year or whatever but he‚Äôs shown he can do it when he wants to. I‚Äôd argue him going on this scoring run but losing isn‚Äôt him ‚Äòcarrying the load‚Äô on offence. 

Just ranting because I love lebron but his passive aggressive body language and lack of effort other than to keep up points to break the record is so frustrating. Everywhere Lebron goes everyone around who were previously good become scape goats and a lot of them become great when they leave him.",1642411547

It doesn't even have to be these three that come to mind. I can think of others who fit the bill. Markelle Fultz is due for a fresh start somewhere in my opinion, though his health has been the major dictator of his career so far, but once something gets going, he might be a suitable role player or a borderline starter.

Last year was an outlier where lebron still not fully healed and AD got injured in pivotal game 4 + the team got mental breakdown after ad injury. 

Lakers can beat both warriors and suns in playoff. 

The problem is ofcourse lack of servicable wing player. Lakers is stacked with good guard both defensive and offensive. 

You got monk nunn reaves bradley tht. But they got almost 0 wing depth. Ariza is washed. Johnson 0 offensive.

And then there is westbrook problem.. if i were lakers, i would not stagger lebron and wb together at all. They just negate each other. Wb should just exclusively play when bron rest. Because there is just no way to fix it even if bron goes to center. 

In the end if the lakers make a trade for a wing or they offload wb for a more fitting player. Lakers can make to final or even win the nba championship. I wont ever count out a healthy ad and bron to win the nba ring.",1642389925

Rudy Gobert is one of the most impactful players in the NBA as shown by the recent stretch of Jazz basketball.

Today in Rudy's return game the team was able to get back to their winning ways and held Denver to 102 points.  
  
The 3x DPOY, 4x All-NBA centers impact in today's blowout win was also on display as Utah suffered with him on the bench, being outscored by 13 points when he sat.

485,nba,what is the cheapest nba basketball team that would outperform the los angeles lakers?,"### What is the cheapest NBA basketball team that would outperform the Los Angeles Lakers?

If you're an NBA fan, you know that the Los Angeles Lakers have been struggling this year.

With a record of 21 wins and 22 losses, they're not an awful team. But, their record is shockingly bad considering the superstars on their roster ‚Äì Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis ‚Äì as well as many big names in their supporting cast.

Their roster is also one of the most expensive in the league (#4), only trailing the similarly star-studded Warriors, Nets, and Clippers.

#### Win shares

I love the idea of Win Shares, a sabermetric concept developed by Bill James that attempts to quantify the ""winning impact"" of individual players. Win Shares have been applied to basketball, too.

Like many basketball statistics, more playing time means you can rack up more Win Shares, but you can control for this by using a Win Shares per 48 Minutes statistic.

Theoretically, Win Shares per 48 should point you in the direction of the players who would have the highest impact on winning. As a sniff test, here are the 5 top WS/48 players of all time:

1.	Michael Jordan .2505
2.	David Robinson	.2502
3.	Wilt Chamberlain	.2480
4.	Neil Johnston	.2413
5.	Chris Paul	.2399

#### Efficiency on efficiency

Those superstars on the Lakers are amazing players, but they're also expensive.

What if we wanted to identify the most impactful winners not only by time on the court, but also per dollar spent on their contracts?

The current Lakers roster has 20.8 Win Shares over 10,012 minutes played in the 2021-2022 season. How cheaply could we field a team that could produce that many Win Shares in 10,000 minutes?

After downloading lots of team and player data from the fine folks over at Basketball Reference, I went ahead and compiled 2021-22 salary data and WS/48, and used a simple formula

`Win shares per 48 per $1M salary`

to figure out which players were having a huge per minute impact, controlled for their salary, and only including players with at least a few hundred (300) minutes played.

#### Diamonds in the Rough

So who's efficient? According to the WS/48/$M statistic, the theoretical squad is:

**Center: Mitchell Robinson.** How is this guy so cheap at $1.8M? ""Lobinson"" is a solid player, snatching 12 rebounds and putting up 12 points per 36, with 2.3 blocks to boot.

**Power Forward: Isaiah Hartenstein.** At first glance, his numbers aren't all that impressive. But per 36, he's averaging a cool double-double with 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists. And he only costs $1.7M for the year.

**Small Forward: Max Strus.** At $1.6M, he can give you efficient 3-point scoring and a couple assists per game.

**Shooting Guard: Austin Reaves.** A Laker! He's a capable scorer for just $925k.

**Point Guard: Gary Payton II.** ""The Mitten"" is a versatile two-way player who can shoot the three, score inside, rebound, steal, and even get the occasional block, all for $1.9M.

Other notables on the bench: Nic Claxton ($1.7M), Hassan Whiteside ($2.4M), Jalen Brunson ($1.8M), √ñmer Yurtseven ($1.4M), and Brandon Clarke ($2.7M). The total salary for the 14-man squad would be a very reasonable $25M, a cost of approximately .57 Russell Westbrooks.

### Could they actually win against the Lakers?

For the top 14 WS/48/$M players, there's not a ton of playmaking outside of Jalen Brunson, the team is overloaded with centers, and only has one actual small forward in Max Strus. So, probably not¬†‚Äì¬†but maybe!

These minor inconveniences aside, this was a fun exercise and I think it did, although hindsight is 20/20, actually identify some really solid players who are on ridiculously great value contracts.",1642384346

496,nba,morey doesn‚Äôt really want to trade simmons ‚Ä¶ yet,"
So much talk about Morey being stupid, massively overvaluing Simmons and should have traded him by now. 

We all know Morey is anything but stupid and usually the smartest guy in the room. So what gives here?  

To me the logical explanation is that he doesn‚Äôt want to trade Simmons yet. Harden still hasn‚Äôt signed with Nets and would be an amazing pick up for Sixers to pair with Embiid. There is the obvious Morey-Harden connection as well. 

Problem is, Sixers cannot just sign Harden in the off season. The only way to really land Harden is a sign and trade with Nets. A Harden for Simmons deal. Here Morey has some leverage with the Nets as Harden could walk for nothing. Plus Simmons fits quite well with the Nets. 

If Morey pulls the trigger on a substandard Simmons trade now, he risks the new player not being of interest to the Nets.  Plus, would be a bad look to trade for a star and then package him 6 mi the later. 

In summary, Morey could well be putting a stupid price on Simmons because he doesn‚Äôt actually want to sell Simmons yet.  Especially as he does not even have to pay Simmons this year by looks of things. 

Of course he can‚Äôt in any way let on that he is doing this deliberately as the it may get him in trouble with agents and players association. 

Ps: the recent talk of Tobias Harris being open for trade talks might also be Morey trying to 1) get a player that the nets would prefer over Simmons, or 2) improve flexibility for Nets trade and/or 3) get more role players to fit around Harden-Embiid. 

Pps: I wouldn‚Äôt mind betting Embiid is in the know here as well and this not putting any pressure on Morey to trade Simmons.",1642382374

517,nba,we need to addresses the phrasing of 'fine the refs' or 'refs are soft' for taunting and player conduct,"We need to redirect this energy, if you're upset at things like the recent Cade Cunningham ejection, or prior ones like the Kyle Lowry ejection for the ball toss.

This is not the referees being soft or getting their feelings hurt. This is the NBA rules and directives from the league as to how these are to be officiated.

Cade ejection as an example, I am confident the referee would be told this is a correct interpretation of the taunting rules. The league stance would be if Jalen Smith was turn around and see Cade pointing, he could then start an altercation with Cade, and in their eyes, hurting the image and product of the league. 

Kyle lowry ball toss, the referee would likely be told  that was a deliberate or reckless ball toss that has potential to set a bad standard for conduct with officials.

If people wish to have the game allowing taunting and that, they need to press the league for changes for officiating directives. 

But referees are going to keep making these calls, if they are coached and told that was the correct interpretation of the rules, or they will get a negative evaluation on the game. Simple.

For my sanity, the infamous Tim duncan Joey Crawford ejection, was actually a bad thing for Joey's career. He had to undergo training, had weeks off games and was severely coached on the situation and for emotional management. This is the same as anyone if they made a substational error in their work.

These people are doing a job, and as much as some may make rushed judgements, the directives on taunting etc are fairly clear and if they like it or not, will continue to call as such.",1642376959

534,nba,does the nba have guidelines on when to override the fan vote for selecting captains?,"So far from reading the rules, the two players w/ the highest fan votes in each conference are captains. We see cases where players who don't deserve to be all stars get a lot of fan votes, and they don't make the all star game due to the media and player all star vote. However, do media and player votes have any impact on the captains?

For example, let's say in 2018, the voting from Georgia and other countries around it were so strong, that Zaza led the west in fan voting. Would he then become a captain of the all star team? 

We haven't had a situation where this has happened, but if it did, does the NBA have any measures to prevent it? Let me know what y'all think.",1642371951

540,nba,observation that i‚Äôve made that the nba is slightly manipulating offense,"TLDR: NBA rigs it‚Äôs rims so more shots are made

We all know the feeling when shooting on a double-rim at the park. Shoot it, know it‚Äôs cash, only for it to clang away because it was off by a millimeter. The reason behind this is how board-stiff the rims are.

As basketball developed, breakaway rims (springing mechanism that allows the rim to bend down) were invented so dunking could be more authoritative and hurt your hand less. 

Then the powers that be noticed, if you are shooting from straight on, and land it on the front of the rim, that springing mechanism absorbs the shock of the ball, allowing a straight on shot to bounce softly, which usually led to a basket.

Watching 90‚Äôs and 00‚Äôs NBA games, the breakaways only bent up and down, but were still somewhat stiff.

The modern NBA rims have breakaway rims that bend easily side to side, up and down, and are so loose that the rim absorbs all the shock of the ball landing on it.

Think of Kawhi‚Äôs game-winning shot over Philly. Watch it in slow motion from different angles, and see how the rim absorbs each bounce, and how easily the rim bends. If that shot happens 20 years ago, it would have bounced out. It‚Äôs subtle manipulation by the NBA to increase the percentage of shots that go in.",1642370638

I think it's important for the center to always be able to carry a team's rim protection and defense in general, but these top two Cavaliers legends at their position lacked those qualities.

Mobley and Allen are the future and just look better defensively. Mobley's mature game is raw but looks to be a future DPOY.

Brad Daugherty is a player that I really dislike because his block stats were sub-par for his height but I don't know his wingspan. He reminds me a lot of Kevin Willis.

576,nba,just a fun exercise i've been pondering: would any of these teams possibly win this year?,"In the age of the superteams and with the Pre-season/Vegas favorites constantly being rattled off as ""LA or Brooklyn?"" it got me wondering if a 1 All-Star team would have a chance. 


So I put together a few starting lineups with only 1 'current' All-Star [career] and because I don't want ""known chemistry"" to play a role I did not put any actual teammates on the same teams. 


Do y'all think any of these teams would have a shot this year to make the Finals vs. actual teams this year? I think the 3 I formed would all have a decent shot, or at least couldn't be an automatic ""no way"". I think all are fairly balanced between offense/defense and at the least could be threats to make conference finals. 


**Team 1:**

C: Jokic

PF: JJJ

SF: Mik Bridges

SG: SGA

PG: FVV

*Strengths:* Strong defensive unit - Jokic with the IQ and plays the passing lanes so well, JJJ has the verticality and shot-blocking ability, I think they'd be tremendous. SGA is statistically the weakest defender but he carries such an offensive load for OKC and is the only target for opposing defenses so it makes sense he doesn't have much left to help on D. I think he has the length/tools to be pretty good with less load on O. Both guards are combo-ish but offer different strengths, with FVV being the better 3pt shooter but SGA with the length and ability to get to the rim they'd be deadly. With Jokic directing the offense from the key they'd be nearly impossible to defend.  


**Team 2:**

C: Myles Turner

PF: Giannis 

SF: Anunoby

SG: Herro

PG: Ja

*Strengths:* Offensive+Defensive punch may be higher peaks than Team 1, but defensively a bit more suspect with Ja + Herro. The frontcourt being so stout would make them strong though, Giannis and Turner altering shots would be a headache for opposing teams. Then with a swiss-army knife like OG, able to guard 1-4 like he can would help cover for Ja. Offensively they'd be crazy getting into the paint, maybe a little weaker from distance, but with Ja improving from there I think they'd be fine. In transition Ja and Giannis together would be insane. 


**Team 3:** 

C: J Allen

PF: J Collins

SF: Ant

SG: Lamelo

PG: Steph

*Strengths:* A little similar in construction to Team 2, with a potent offensive punch from the backcourt and then a strong defensive frontcourt with Allen and Collins. Ant is a bit of a wildcard due to being a bit raw, but with Lamelo's passing and ability to draw defensive attention, he'd get wide open looks from 3 - without even mentioning of course how much gravity Steph draws. Collins is also a very underrated 3pt shooter as he's at 44% right now, so they'd be spreading the floor with 4 shooters and then have Allen as the role man. Despite Melo and Ant being a bit young, I don't think it takes much to see just how dangerous this team could be, especially with Steph at the helm.",1642364095

The guy absolutely deserves to be the All Star Game. Sure, the Spurs are 12th in the Western Conference, but I think they would be in last place without Dejounte. There's nobody else on that team (sorry Spurs fans).

**Dejounte Murray this season:** 8.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.1 steals, and 19.1 points. 

Meanwhile, Russell Westbrook, Dame, and Klay Thompson are all in the top 10? That's a joke. No offense to any of those guys, but Klay has played in three games, Dame has played FAR below his potential, and the same as Dame goes for Russ.

Dejounte Murray means far more to his team this season, than any of these guys do to their teams. Sadly, it looks like Dejounte will miss a deserved all-star appearance just because the Spurs have a non-flashy play style and sit at 12th in the western conference.",1642354563

701,nba,the nuggets are 9-0 when bones hyland scores 10 or more.,"The Denver Nuggets are 9-0 when Bones Hyland scores 10 or more.

They are 9-13 when he plays but fails to score 10 points.

They are 4-6 when he doesn‚Äôt play.

The Nuggets are also 15-5 when he plays more than 15 minutes.

With Murray and other guards missing games, Hyland has stepped up to become one of the only non-Jokic shot creators on the Nuggets and the bench almost requires a strong performance from Hyland or Barton.

The consistency in his shot and release, he could come off the dribble, off screens, spot up, no matter what it looked the same and it was probably going in. Even his misses were good, I don't think he ever shot a bad shot.

The NBA hall of fame is huge, I feel like everybody who had a big impact on the game gets in, so call me crazy but as one of the premiere 3 point shooters of all time and the impact he had on the game, I wouldn't be surprised if Kyle got some deserving love from the HOF voters at some point.",1642333315

The Mavericks still haven‚Äôt afforded former Villanova point guard Jalen Brunson a contract extension and he has made another leap this season. As The Post has reported multiple times, the Knicks have had Brunson on their radar.

Brunson‚Äôs father is Rick Brunson ‚Äî Leon Rose‚Äôs initial client when he started his sports agency business out of Cherry Hill, N.J. Thibodeau has had the elder Brunson on his staff for years before he rejoined the Knicks.

With ‚ÄúT-Day‚Äô‚Äô approaching in 3 ¬π/‚ÇÇ weeks, the Mavericks are certainly capable of moving Brunson before the 2018 second-round pick becomes an unrestricted free agent.

The Knicks already contacted the Mavericks sometime in the past about Brunson, an NBA source said.

‚ÄúThey want him bad,‚Äô‚Äô the NBA source said.

Missing at least one of them they are 4-10

This comes in a season where the Cavs lost Collin Sexton and Ricky Rubio for the season. Without our guards our bench unit has fallen off hard. Before Ricky got injured the Cavs blew out 8 teams by over 25 within the span of 11 games.

He‚Äôs widely inefficient, having a 50% or higher in only 4 games all year. And only having higher than a 40% fg in 12 games. Shooting 37% from the field and 5.8 assists on 3.7 turnovers a game 

My personal thoughts is that he‚Äôs more inclined for a playmaking Terrence Mann role. And I think the Rockets gave him the keys to the offense too quickly. The second he got traded here he was playing like Harden in g league and then was allowed to play the same way on the main team. Though, he was considerably better last year than this.",1642321934

728,nba,who do you think the play-in teams will be in the western conference?,"With Dallas and Denver picking up steam lately, the top 6 is looking like it'll be some combination of PHX, GSW, MEM, UTA, DAL, and DEN. But what about the play-in teams?

The Lakers (7th right now) have one of the hardest schedules and look like a complete mess. The Clippers (8th right now) might be without PG and Kawhi for the whole season, so I could see them miss the 'yin altogether. The Blazers (10th right now) just had Dame have surgery. I'm assuming they'll shut him down for the season at some point and tank.

The Lakers might make some mid-season trades a la 2015 or 2018 Cavs, so don't count them out yet. I'm expecting them to fall to 8th below the Timberwolves, though. The other two play-in spots are trickier since there are a lot of mediocre teams in the west this year. My hot take is that the Pelicans will insert themselves into the mix, even without Zion, as LAC and POR slip in the standings. When Zion *does* come back, they will be in a good position to potentially claim a playoff spot. I would give the last spot to the Kings just because they've been through a lot. Let them have this.

So my prediction is **7th Minnesota, 8th LA Lakers, 9th New Orleans, 10th Sacramento**, with Portland, the LA Clippers, San Antonio, OKC, and Houston on the outside.",1642321512

738,nba,make your best prediction right now for how far the los angeles lakers will go in the 2022 playoffs,"The lakers have been struggling this season. Two seasons ago they were champions. Early in the season prior they were favorites to make the finals but fell apart with injuries in round 1. This season they make some big moves including landing Westbrook. A controversial decision with controversial results thus far. AD is currently unable to play due to injury.

Right now we are about halfway through the season and they currently are riding near the .500 mark with 21 wins and 22 losses. 

They are far from championship contenders by many metrics. However, they still have Lebron James who is still playing exceptionally at 37, and they can hope AD will return to compete (ya know, the guy who was a top 5/10 player paired with another top 5 player to win a ring 2 years ago).

At the pace they are going at, it doesn't look good (I know, groundbreaking commentary).

No sub 500 team has ever won a championship.

The lowest win percentage of an NBA championship team ever was the Washington Bullets in 1977-78 season with a 44-37 record (.537). 

The lowest seeded team ever to win a championship was the sixth seed Houston Rockets in 1994/1995.

The 2021/2022 Lakers at this pace are likely to compete in the play in tournament in this years playoffs.

So now we get to the fun part. What's your prediction? How far do the Lakers go (or not go) in this years playoffs?

Are the Lakers truly doomed as most indicators point to? Can Lebron carry this team, with or without AD, to a championship and make history as the (possible) worst record/seeded champion in nba history? Will Westbrook make some serious improvement in performance and chemistry in a short span of time proving the haters wrong? Will the Lebron led Lakers fail miserably causing Skip Bayless to cream his pants? 

I'm expecting quite a lot of straightforward ""nah"" type answers. Hoping we got a few crazy brave people who are willing to go as specific as possible.

It'll be fun to look back on this post and see who had the most accurate prediction so have at it.",1642314891

That being said, the Celtics and the Lakers are the most boring, uninspiring brand of basketball I‚Äôve seen all season. No life, no energy. Just ugly basketball.

I know the Celtics won tonight, and I am a Celtics fan, but just watching basketball every night and watching every team, both the lakers and Celtics have no redeeming, inspiring factors to their teams. At least the bad teams like Orlando, Detroit and Houston can look forward to their young players growing and on the lottery.

Both rosters have no young player to be excited about (don‚Äôt say the jays they are in year 5 and 6), very little ways to improve, lakers being a HORRID defensive team with zero signs of improvement and the Celtics being a horrid offensive team with no signs of improvement.

Just an interesting wrinkle because of how legendary these two franchises are. Watching their games are like a chore at this point. But you know what to expect and what you‚Äôre going to get at the end of the day.

So did players like Kobe and MJ. What players other than Westbrook don‚Äôt really have the same, or vice versa with godly basketball IQ but not that much athleticism?

The recovery times of these kinds of knee sprain are generally measured in weeks.  With only ten days left until the next matchup, it is highly unlikely for Durant to make a return.

778,nba,why hasn't lebron been able to dominate the league by winning everything for a few years straight ever like say the warriors did?,"It seems that LeBron in his entire career had a few highs but always mixed up with some lows. He would go to the finals but lose. Lose. Lose. Lose. Win. Win. Lose. Lose. Win. Lose. Or something along those lines. While he did do great by just going to the finals most of the time, he never got the 3 wins in a row score to corroborate his all-time greatness.

Now that the end of his career approaches, we are left wondering just what kept him from being the all-time basketball god some people wish he was.

Perhaps the criticisms have never gotten into LeBron's skin like they do nowaways on the Lakers. Maybe LeBron will become a little more grumpy as a result.

Do you think LeBron has won enough already? Who will take the reins starting this year? Maybe Giannis if the Bucks run it back-to-back?",1642307572

Option A - tricky

Lakers go to a team and tell them they will pay them off the books to take  Russ in a trade. 

Option B - trickier

Lakers management goes to Russ and tells him to not to accept his player option, in return they pay him a larger amount behind the scenes off the books.

I figure it's easier to do shady shit with an organization than somehow paying Russ directly behind the scenes.

Scenario C

Lakers tell Russ how ass he is and how bad they want to trade him.

Westbrook gets a reality check, is heartbroken. Both parties agree to null his contract since WB and LA don't want him there.",1642307350

They were doing well, hoping they could actually be contenders. Top of their conference and looking to prove that they were legit against two proven legit contenders. Then they get absolutely fucking housed two games in a row and fumble a close game against a Celtics team that has been awful in close games. 

Has to be extremely deflating. No one believes they can be anything close to real contenders anymore. The facade is over. Everyone suspected that they were probably not real contenders (lacking a top 10 player and can‚Äôt make up for it with defense), but there was mild hope that they could be a new style of team to compete at a high level. 

And here we are. All hope is lost.",1642307157

Anthony Davis being out is part of it. But they have absolutely zero shot creation outside LeBron. THT is fucking terrible at nearly everything. No perimeter defense. It's not just a Russell thing. The Lakers roster looks nearly unfixable.",1642306193
796,nba,darius garland had more assists(18) than the thunder (17) tonight.,"Garland is continuing to make a stellar case for this year's all-star team. He added 27 points. Garland have really come into his own since Sexton has been injured. Garland has propelled himself into the top of the young prospect rankings, especially tonight where he outplayed another young star in SGA. Strangely Garland has made himself the third best player in the draft class. Improved leaps every year from his disastrous rookie year.",1642306144

His turnovers have lowered down recently but his scoring performances were subpar. Today, he had a solid game and was a -11, which pales in comparison to LeBron‚Äôs 17.

He‚Äôs been playing out of his mind of late and was the catalyst that sparked an 18 point comeback against the Thunder tonight on the second night of a back to back.

Ayo Dosunmu tonight:

21 points 
10 assists 
4 rebounds 
90% FG

Dosunmu also guarded Jayson tatum quite a bit throughout the game and did well, and the Bulls nearly stole a game in Boston missing 6 rotation players. Dosunmu deserves All-Rookie team for sure, as he is playing his role off the bench perfectly. How in the world did the league let him drop to 38.",1642305497

I think he will be snubbed but do you guys think he actually may have a case over any of these 3 guys who are the most commonly discussed to make it in?

Right now, they‚Äôre 27-18, good for 4th in the East, and in danger of falling to 6th. 

I guess you can say ‚Äúthey‚Äôre a championship team, they‚Äôll go on a win streak‚Äù, but they have the league‚Äôs toughest schedule for the remainder of the season. They haven‚Äôt even played the Bulls yet this year.

Have they become too complacent? Right now when I see Milwaukee I don‚Äôt see a team that just won a championship.",1642299073

His last two seasons he has dipped to 65% from the line so this is a better conversion rate for him relative to our recent expectations.

11/20 FG

5/9 FT

Tonight was definitive evidence that the Raptors are cursed, forever doomed to lose to the Pistons so long as Dwane Casey is their coach because they managed to beat the Bucks for the third time this season, on a back-to-back, and this time hey had Giannis.  Definitely more turnovers than you'd like from Pascal and OG tonight (OG fouled out tonight) and the starters continue to see limited help from the bench but a win is a win, and on a back-to-back without Scottie and Gary Trent Jr., it's great to see Pascal back into his pre-pandemic form.

There's no excuse for not knowing the score, so I thought he deserved every single bit of criticism he received. So I just watched it again and it his me, why didn't Kerr call a timeout as soon as JR got the rebound? They had one left, and while Hill was setting up for the FT Kerr could've let a ref know that they got the offensive rebound he wants a timeout right away. Seems like Kerr was unprepared for the situation as well. Am I missing something here?",1642298305

**Findings:**

* Like I added in the far right column; The second highest ppg for somebody playing in their 19th NBA season was Kareem with 14.6 ppg, in 1988. **This is half the ppg that LeBron is averaging this year, in his same season number.**
* Kobe is on the list three times; in his 16th, 17th and 20th seasons.
* Carmelo Anthony is actually scoring the third highest ppg ever for somebody in their 19th season. He's averaging 13.2 ppg.",1642298032

Even when his scoring is off, he is almost guaranteed to have a positive impact on the court due to his unprecedented basketball IQ and playmaking skills. Also, he will always get a lot of attention from the opposition defenders, due to the fact that he has the ability to completely take over the game at any time. Last but not least, I think that having Luka and Embiid gives you at least a 5 year contending window. 

Having that in mind, I think that I might be a little bit biased, because I am a Mavs fan. Philly fans seem to value Maxey and Thybulle a lot and Morey specifically thinks that trading only Ben requires an all-star caliber player. On the other hand, I do not think that there is any chance that the Mavs will do that trade, despite the fact that it would probably make them the deepest team in the league.

969,nba,garbage time - query,"Been a fan for a few years now after being introduced to the NBA by my best friend in 20-16/17 and have been to watch my team play in the Garden (C‚Äôs fan..yes, for my sins). Currently chatting about and debating this specific point with said friend - garbage time is obviously known as being the time in a game where Team A has a healthy lead and Team B has little chance of winning so both teams play their second unit/bench to see the game out.

Are there any examples in the past of Team B‚Äôs bench unit putting together a crazy run against Team A and actually winning the game? 

Seems unlikely as garbage time usually lasts a few minutes at the most but also not completely inconceivable. Thanks in advance!",1642286280

Scoring wise they could go either way I'd take Steph because of his efficiency and some would take KD because of his ability to get a good look anywhere. 

In terms of playmaking and passing Steph is leagues above KD, nobody makes his teammates better like Steph, his offball movement creates so many open looks and his passing is quite good as well.  

Defensively I rate them about the same, though prime Steph was a steals leader so he edges KD slightly in this regard.

Leadership definitely goes to Steph, no question.

So how is KD a better player than Steph? Does being a slightly better scorer (this is debatable) make the rest of the things Steph brings to the table irrelevant?",1642281437

I‚Äôm generally looking for more current ones or in the last few years


Hornets:

Favourite: hot take but I love the purple CHA jerseys that we used last night, I used to hate them but I swear they look better every time we wear them. It‚Äôs also arguably the most unique colour scheme in the league so that helps, it rlly just feels special to me. The mint city edition jerseys were also great last year. The city edition jerseys we have this year look great on some players but rlly weird on others so idk abt those.

Least favourite: I rlly don‚Äôt like the blue main jerseys the hornets wear. They look so off to me for some reason and the white ones are so much better. I‚Äôm almost disappointed when I see they‚Äôre wearing the blues.

Other teams 

Grizz: I rlly like the dark blues with the cool decals on the side that they use, defiantly one of my favourites.

OKC: I actually rlly like the thunders city edition this year, I honestly think the loves logo on it looks great.

Heat: heat have a lot of great jerseys but pls never wear the pink to blue fade ones. Great concept but too much on the court imo.

Rockets; I used to hate the rockets old unis for some reason, especially the red with white as the secondary, they‚Äôve cleaned them up now and they look better

Hawks, this is a while ago but that weird design they had the last couple of years of the horford/Teague era were awful. Love their jerseys now especially the MLK edition last year and the yellows this year.

Pacers: prob one of the worse uniforms imo, I kinda like the pinstripes but everything else is meh at best. Should be part of their retool but that colour scheme is kind of hard to work with",1642272624
1019,nba,what are your mid-season predictions for the final standings?,"So here are my predictions for the final standings this season, and i would like you guys to share yours

East:
1. Bucks
2. Heat
3. Nets
4. Bulls
5. Sixers
6. Cavs
7. Hornets
8. Raptors
9. Wizards
10. Celtics
11. Knicks
12. Hawks
13. Pacers
14. Pistons
15. Magic

Yes, call me a delusional Bucks fan, but i do think my team could go on a streak or multiple streaks, and finish as the no. 1 seed, especially now that H&amp;S protocls stuff has calmed down. Our  floor is at least Confrence Finals. Heat are currently 2nd, with jimmy and bam missing half the games, which is pretty impressive imo, so i think they could eevn be no 1, but i still think bucks are better. As for the Nets, theyve been struiggling, and i think they would want kyrie back for as many games as possible, so i think theyll aim for the lower seed and sorta ""tank"". Bulls on the other hand just lost Lavine to knee injury... still, it could be for just 5 games max and they still in top 3, but idk...

West:

1. Suns
2. Warriors
3. Grizzlies
4. Jazz
5. Mavericks
6. Nuggets
7. Wolves
8. Lakers
9. Clippers
10. Kings
11. Pelicans
12. Trail Blazers
13. Spurs
14. Thunder
15. Rockets

I have much less to say about west then the east tbh. Lakers so far only won to bad teams, so i think them beign the 8th seed is fitting. As someone on this sub said, ""you have to beat the lakers to be above average team"". Im pretty hgih on the wolves, so i do think they could be even 6th seed, but theyre definetly at least a play-in team. Clippers might miss Kawhi and PG for the reast of season, and if they do, theyre not making the playoffs. Same for Portland.

As one last thing, ill say this: my matchup for the finals is Bucks vs Warriors

This is his highest PPG average in 7 years, matches his career high in assists,  his career high in FG% and his career high in 3pt%.

He's no longer being relegated to his ""sit in the corner and shoot 3s"" role of his last several years, being integrated into the offense as a cutter with a killer 8-foot floater and playmaker out of the high block.

For a team missing their two best players for half the season, PJ Tucker is one of the primary reasons for Miami's continued success. In the last **15 games**, Tucker is averaging 11/5.4/3.1 with 1spg on 49/52/69 on 3.6 3PA.

Consider a team, let's say the 2013-14 Orlando Magic. We look at their pace, which is an approximation of **possessions per 48 minutes**. We can use this information to figure out their approximate **possessions per minute**, which in this case is *93.6/48=1.95* possessions per minute. This number we can multiply by any players total minutes in order to approximate their total possessions per season, (for example Maurice Harkless had about 3802.5 possessions that season). And this works for any season where pace is available.

With this you can figure out any players per 100 stats. For example Maurice Harkless' 3PA/100 was *(154\*100)/(3802.5)=4.0 3PA/100*, where the per 100 formula for any given stat is: *(stat\*100)/(poss)*. You can check all of this information on basketball-reference, which is where I got all my data at.

Steph currently has 3024 3-pointers made for his career. This year's league average for 3FG% is .349.

For Steph to drop to that mark, the first thing we need to find out his how many total attempts does he need, assuming that his makes stay constant.

The simple math:

3024 / X = .349  
X = 3024 / .349  
X = 8664.8

So Steph would need 8665 total attempts, making none for the rest of his career.

His current attempts total is 7040. That means he would need to take and miss **1625 consecutive shots** for his career average to dip to the league mark of .349.

That's roughly 4 full seasons (82 games) where he take and misses 5 attempts a game. Or 5 full seasons of taking and missing 4 a game.

Then I would also say SGA, Jrue, Middleton, Bam, Dejounte Murray, Ant, Zion, Draymond, Gobert, Jaylen Brown, VanVleet, Siakam, OG Anunoby, Sabonis

Kawhi, Klay, Kyrie, Dame, and Jamal Murray who have all missed the entire year essentially, but I think damn near everyone picks them over Simmons in a heartbeat (or in dames case, just having an awful year, and yet based on Moreys thirst for him, I think it's safe to assume Dame still has more value).

1086,nba,lakers - kings interesting trade idea,"The trade: 

Kings receive Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook

Lakers receive De'Aaron Fox, Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield

The Lakers would operate under the assumption that Anthony Davis' best days are behind him and that they can't rely on him staying healthy in the next years. They also get rid of Westbrook (seemingly impossible) while getting a perfect player to play with LeBron (Hield). They would also get some young players for their salvaged future.

The Kings would hope to build around Davis and keep him healthy. Westbrook has also shown he's a much better player when not that many eyes are on him. They don't have anything to lose anyways, might as well take a swing.

Honestly I just can‚Äôt get down with those explanations lol. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but didn‚Äôt Wade take a paycut for Miami as well during the Big 3 era and Wade‚Äôs reasoning for going to Chicago was because Miami refused to pay him after his contract ended?

1098,nba,"a funny story, figured i‚Äôd share. if you have one i‚Äôd love to hear it as well. not nba related but basketball related.","A post I read made me remember this so here enjoy:

I was never much of a basketball player growing up and at best I became average at it. In high school I wrestled, I played travel football semi pro and helped coach girls lacrosse. I had decent athleticism at 5‚Äô4 140 lbs so when we had students versus faculty(mostly former ball players)basketball game naturally I was one of the first students picked.

I was a starter(even though I‚Äôd never played basketball other than in gym class before) and was tasked with guarding Coach Calvin. Now coach was older, was one of the coaches always giving me a hard time for not playing football for the school and was also left handed like myself. So I‚Äôm ready for this.

One of the kids who played for coach Cal kept telling me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let him go left, you should be able to lock coach down cause you way faster and stronger.‚Äù Cool my head is pumped up, ready to go, I played sports so I wasn‚Äôt afraid of challenges. I played Defensive end and Defensive Back so I was used to battling with little to no help and I‚Äôm thinking I should be fine.

First qtr, things going good. Coach Cal hasn‚Äôt scored but he also didn‚Äôt handle the rock much. Our team is a couple scores in front of the faculty and I‚Äôm thinking this isn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt that hard. A couple minutes left in the first I STRIP Coach Cal, full sprint to the basket layup but got high enough to dunk it. Another of my classmates gets a steal right after that and dunks.

‚ÄúOh so y‚Äôall dunkers huh, but you ain‚Äôt wanna play for a coach Cal. Oh y‚Äôall that fast huh but you don‚Äôt wanna play for Coach P!‚Äù Coach Cal says to me. Then the next words I hear are ‚Äúgimme the rock!‚Äù Three. Defensive stop. Three. Missed shot, Three. Damn coach Cal got 9. 

Start of the 3rd qtr I looked at the score board it said 51- 33. Coach Cal looks me right in the eye and says imma see if we can FINALLY get this scoreboard to 100. He proceeds to continue dropping buckets on me. They bring other guys off the bench like maybe someone else can slow him down NOPE Coach Cal abuse them easily go right by them. I get back in he‚Äôs spraying me left and right. At one point during this murdering one of the basketball players is like just poke his elbow ‚Äúcoach Cal was like do it and imma light you up even more‚Äù and he did. That was the first person I ever met who could shoot through the Jordan trick.

4th qtr comes, we down 50+ points, score board says 100+ points, Coach Cal ends up with 56, then he looks at me and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got great defense and strong hands for rebounding one of the best defenders I‚Äôve gone against‚Äù I almost cried I laughed so hard. This man had 56 points, 56.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the end. No redemption I had 8 points. One of my best high school memories was getting abused by the basketball coach in front of the entire school.",1642240627

Porzingis: 7th in PPG for frontcourt high BPM, VORP, WS, and PER.

- Notable people missing in the top 15: Embiid at 6.9 and KD at 4.2 

- The gap between 1st and 3rd place (Curry vs Jrue) is the same as the gap between 14th place and 4th place

- Both Curry, Jokic, and Gobert are far above their teammates, which suggests time and time again that they elevate the team at far higher level than people believe. The Warriors are net negative this season with Curry off the floor. And it is not the first time Curry has led the league in net rating despite not being on the top seed team, he's been top 5 consistently since 2014, excluding 2020 and 2021.

- Giannis has been the most consistent competitor in net rating to Curry

- Patty Mills, DLo, DeRozan, and Garland have also been killing it this season compared to their teammates",1642226840

1132,nba,cam reddish wanted a bigger role/more mins‚Ä¶i highly doubt he gets that on the knicks.,"I think the majority of r/nba thinks that the Knicks ripped off the Hawks in the Cam Reddish trade. However, I seriously doubt Reddish will even get that many mins on the Knicks. 

The Knicks have a bunch of on-ball players already in Kemba Walker, Julius Randle, Alec Burks, and Derrick Rose (when he comes back). They also have multiple wing players in RJ Barrett, Evan Fournier, and even their lottery pick from last year in Obi Toppin. They also have other young players in Immanuel Quickley and Quentin Grimes. 

I see Reddish having the exact same issue he had on the Hawks. He thinks he should get a bigger role, but I highly doubt he will. In the best case, he‚Äôs a 7th/8th option off the bench. In the worst case, he might even be the 10th option and stuck on the bench. I would be surprised if he plays more mins/game than he did with the Hawks. Also Thibs doesn‚Äôt care about developing young players - he cares about maximizing what he has, so he won‚Äôt go out of his way to play Reddish. 

Of course, Reddish hasn‚Äôt really shown that much anyways in the NBA aside from the occasional great highlight, but even if you think he can develop into a good player, I don‚Äôt see a pathway for him developing on the Knicks. This can change if they somehow trade like Fournier or some other players, but that would be quite difficult to do. There is a reason no one really wanted Reddish.",1642224163

1198,nba,these last two bulls losses are more about personality to me.,"I know the bulls need depth in the front court. But ALL season I‚Äôve felt that we need someone who won‚Äôt accept efforts like tonight, and yesterday. 
And definitely not on back to back games. You‚Äôre always going to have a flop here and there.
But you think if Draymond, or Noah, or Butler was on this team, that this would‚Äôve happened in consecutive games? No.

You think if Pop, or Thibs was coaching this team, you‚Äôd have consecutive losses like this? As a number one seed? No. 

Every player on this team is the nice guy. Our coach is also the nice guy.
We need someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to call everyone out.

Steph Curry was asked, ‚ÄúWhat does Draymond do at half time?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre winning, nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre losing, he‚Äôs yelling.‚Äù

Nobody likes being yelled at, obviously, but sometimes a good kick in the a$$ is necessary. And this Bulls team lacks that grit. 

Also, this is the first time in NBA history the #1 seed in any conference has lost consecutive games by 25+. And we were down almost 40 in both. 

Someone needs to bark.

1206,nba,james borrego not the right coach for lamelo ball.,"LaMelo Ball is getting very low minutes, for someone playing as good as him. Evident is tonight‚Äôs game, he goes on a run, and gets subbed out. Then he gets put back in when the team is now down.

I‚Äôve been observing this for the entirety of last season and this season as well ever since he has come to Charlotte. This coach clearly doesn‚Äôt like him on the court.

Let me give you another example. James Borrego will sometimes sub out Terry Rozier and put it in let‚Äôs say Cody Martin. Then when a few minutes pass, he‚Äôll replace LaMelo with Terry so we still have 1 of the 2 on the court.

But when LaMelo is out, he will never replace Terry in this situation. As we have seen today, it was Ish Smith who hasn‚Äôt played the last couple games.

I seriously think LaMelo would put out better games had he have a coach who could play him in better rotations.

TL;DR James Borrego has awful rotations and doesn‚Äôt play LaMelo properly.",1642216016

Don't get me wrong I love Ham and really do think he's one of the best Assistant Coaches in the league. He will be a fine head coach one day. But Bud is on another level.

1344,nba,memphis grizzlies mid-season player grades,"Well, friends, we‚Äôve done it. We have passed the midway point of the NBA season. Looking back, did you expect that the Grizzlies would be in 3rd place in the West and the hottest team in the game and seeking to maintain home court advantage for the playoffs? I sure didn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm thoroughly enjoying this pleasant surprise.

With forty-plus games under our belt, I invite you along for the journey of my annual mid-season player grading tradition. These grades are biased and based on my preseason assumptions and projections of each player. For example, Player X could be the 9th guy on the roster, but if he is punching above his weight, he will grade out well. This isn‚Äôt a top to bottom grade, where the highest grades are reserved for the elite players. Everyone has a chance to earn their own marks based on their own merits. You get the picture. Let‚Äôs get to it

**Ja Morant - A+**

It‚Äôs hard to even find a starting point to talk about Morant. I could wax poetic for hours about his ascension into the elites of the league and how his success has catapulted the Grizzlies into the national spotlight. As of this writing, Morant is 7th in the league with a PER in excess of 25. He is averaging north of 25 points, 6 assists, and 5 rebounds per game. Oh yeah, and he‚Äôs only seeing the floor for 32 minutes per night.

Ja is an elite finisher at the rim, despite having terrible shot quality there because everyone is gameplaning for him (and failing). He is getting to the dish at a rate worthy of the 98th percentile of guards and earns every basket he gets at rack. Ja takes shots that are contested, but still manages to convert. Over 60% of his shots are at the rim or floaters in the vicinity. Morant has mastered the levitating-and-releasing-at-the-last-second shot which has won multiple games for the Grizzlies. On top of his paint dominance, Morant has grown his game outside the three point line and is converting over one and a half threes per game on 38% perimeter shooting. His offensive [RAPTOR ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)metrics are top-ten worthy and in every case the analytics match the eye test.

**Desmond Bane - A+**

What makes me chuckle every time Bane swishes a three, is that 29 other teams passed on him on draft night. He‚Äôs a Grizzly and that‚Äôs awesome. He doesn‚Äôt back down from anyone (ahem, LeBron James) and is a true gamer. Bane is averaging a trio of triples per game and is still hitting 43% of his threes on the season and for his career. What‚Äôs wild is that per BBall Index, Desmond is only in the 29th percentile when it comes to shot openness. These are contested shots he is drilling. The guard out of TCU has splashed in 20 or more points on eighteen occasions this season. Bane is carrying an immense offensive load for this young Grizzlies team. Also, with Dillon Brooks missing several stints due to injuries and COVID, Bane has been given the opportunity to showcase his defensive grit as well. Over 25% of the time this season, Bane has been tasked with guarding the opponent‚Äôs highest usage player - giving him invaluable exposure and experience. He‚Äôs done so much this season, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs slowing down any time soon.

Bonus points for being cocky on the court‚Ä¶and being able [to back it up](https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1480396598400065538?s=20).

**Jaren Jackson Jr. - A**

This season, Jaren has been a nightmare matchup on both ends of the floor. The 22 year old seven-footer is third in the league in total blocks and is showing All-NBA levels of defense across the board. As one of my friends put it: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs roving around down there like a mobile Gobert‚Äù. On the offensive side of the ball, Jaren has been as streaky as ever, with career lows in most areas of scoring, including points per shot attempt, where he is in the [bottom quartile](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4439#tab-shooting_overall) of the league. However, one encouraging thing to note is that Jaren is settling less for the three point shot and is taking additional chances to drive, dash, and spin to the rim for a higher chance opportunity. He is taking nearly 30 percent of his shots in the floater range instead of tossing up shots further from the rack.

When Jackson is on the floor, the Grizzlies are a net plus-12 points per 100 possessions, which is in the 91st percentile. While the Grizzlies‚Äô offense is only a bucket per 100 better with him on the court, he is making an elite level impact on defense. Memphis gives up nearly 10 points per 100 possessions fewer points with Jackson on the court. In the past, it didn‚Äôt seem like Jaren and Ja were vibing on the court, which was obviously cause for great concern. Your two franchise cornerstones need to be able to play in cohesion. That is not the case this year. Ja and Jaren are plus-7.7 points per 100 when sharing the court. Contrast this to last year when the duo was minus-21.2(!!) points per 100 and you get a little insight into how much Jaren has improved since last season. Teams are forced to respect his shot on the perimeter, which opens up driving lanes for his teammates. On defense, he can block a shot from anywhere and has made multiple timely plays already this season. [Just ask reigning MVP Nikola Jokic.](https://twitter.com/6toHombreLATAM/status/1456085623387869184?s=20)

**Tyus Jones - A-**

Tyus served as a steadying force for the Grizzlies when Ja was out and we should be thankful to have him on the roster. He was Mr. Steady with his low usage, high assist to turnover ratio, and consistent play. I haven‚Äôt heard much chatter about this, but I would like to point out that he is hitting over 40% from three - albeit on less than three attempts per game. Jones has made the most of his time running the show and is having a hell of a contract year. His 8 points and 4 assists might not look super sexy on the stat sheet, but those watching the games understand the impact he is having on a nightly basis. No matter how many minutes he is called upon to play, he is usually ready and willing. In no way does he possess the offensive firepower that Morant does - he is nothing near the playmaker or shot taker - but he knows how to run an offense and involve his teammates. On the defensive side of things, I credit him along with Dillon Brooks with helping to ignite the fire across the board.

**Steven Adams - B**

If you're a hater who is still upset that the Grizzlies moved Jonas Valanciunas to NOLA for Adams, then you probably won‚Äôt like his grades or my overall opinion of the situation. Adams is the most dominant offensive rebounder in the NBA this season and a big part of why Memphis is one of the most successful teams when it comes to second chance points. He does not need to score the ball or control offensive possessions in order to positively impact the game. With the Adams/JV swap, the Memphis offense instantly created 7 more shots for guys like Bane and Morant. Shots by those players physically open up the court and add more additional opportunities for the rest of the team. Steven is third on the Grizzlies in assists, behind only Ja and Tyus. That‚Äôs one area where he has exceeded my expectations - I was unaware of how good of a passer he truly is. Adams plays a pivotal role on this roster and he has done everything that he needs to do - set hard screens, rebound, and make savvy passes.

**Brandon Clarke - B+**

After a tough season last year, Clarke is back to his high-flying and efficient-scoring self. Per Cleaning the Glass, he is scoring 133.7 points per 100 shot attempts, which puts him at the top of the league among forwards. He is back to his bread and butter and crushing it in the dunker spot. He is taking roughly 90% of his shots at the rim or in the short mid-range. The three point is not part of his arsenal, but he is making teams pay for their extra focus on his teammates, converting at an eFG rate of 65%. BC is also dishing the ball out for assists at the best rate of his three NBA seasons. In only 17 minutes per game, he is pulling in 1.9 offensive rebounds and blocking a shot per contest. This is the efficient and effective Brandon Clarke that [Memphis fans expected to see](https://twitter.com/grizzonbally/status/1479931731650174978?s=21) more of following an exceptional rookie season.

**Dillon Brooks - B**

Between injuries and COVID protocols, Dillon the Villain has missed a lot of gametime this season. When Ja was out, Dillon took full advantage and racked up career highs in shot attempts. Big shocker there. He is having a down year from the three point line, but when Brooks is on the floor, the Grizzlies are just better. Dillon is opting to take less threes per game and is getting to the rim more than in past seasons. His assist numbers are also up this year, with a significant portion of those going to Jaren.

On the defensive side of the ball, the Grizzlies are much more staunch with Dillon than without. Per CTG, Memphis gives up 6.2 fewer points per 100 possessions with him on the court. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the Grizzlies defensive-minded tenacity and culture started to reappear once Brooks reentered the lineup.

**John Konchar - B+**

Konchar‚Äôs efficiency is almost laughable - in the best way. This guy is in the basement for usage (2nd percentile) among guards, but is in the 95th percentile for points per shot attempt. What a frustrating player for an opponent to have thrown into their gameplan. He plays 16 minutes per night and always seems to muck things up and get involved in the most undercover way (until it‚Äôs not). Konchar has actually seen some run in pretty impactful situations and can be trusted as someone who is going to make the most of his minutes.

**Killian Tillie - B**

The undrafted stretch big out of Gonzaga has been solid for Memphis this year. He‚Äôs done well enough that the team converted his contract from a two way to a full time agreement. When the Grizzlies were short handed, he stepped up and even started a few games. He fell out of the draft due to injury concerns and Memphis picked him up on the cheap and he has earned a contract upgrade in basically half of a season, so props to him.

**Ziaire Williams - B**

I was going to give Z a C, but if I go back and look at my draft board and notes, I admit that I wasn‚Äôt super high on the Williams pick at the time - therefore setting the bar and my expectations low. Before Williams went down with an ankle injury earlier in the year, he was pretty much terrible and his play was hurting the Grizzlies each night. The guy was on track for a negative WAR for crying out loud. Since he has returned from injury, he‚Äôs been a new man. He‚Äôs flying high above the rim, taking big time shots without intrepidation, and playing tough defense. His play has been night and day and this makes me optimistic about the future. I think he now knows his role on this team and the rest of the squad is helping him grow and develop as a young player in this league.

**Kyle Anderson - B-**

Last season, Kyle was so critical to this team and helped hold it all together during times of distress and times without Ja. He had a career season last year and we are now in the reality that he has come back down to earth and settled into his more permanent role as a glue guy on this roster. Anderson does a little bit of everything and typically rises to the occasion. When in a pinch, Taylor Jenkins has rotated Kyle over to guard the opponent‚Äôs best player after Dillon and Jaren get their 15th fouls of the game. The bad news on Kyle this year is that the Grizzlies are overall pretty rough when he‚Äôs out there - to the tune of minus-12.9 points per 100 possessions. The numbers there are kind of muddy because a lot of that has to do with lineups. When KA is playing the three with Jaren and Adams in the frontcourt, things are ugly. But when Kyle is playing the small-ball four, he is able to outwit opponents and gain an edge.

**Xavier Tillman - C**

Tillman has seen a decrease in minutes this season and hasn‚Äôt seemed himself on either side of the floor. His impact has been sporadic, but I wouldn‚Äôt count out the versatile big man who played a big role in the playoffs last season for the Grizzlies.

**De‚ÄôAnthony Melton - C**

I did not expect to be grading out Melton this low, but this season he has yet to grab his opportunities by the horns. He is getting more reps this season, but his shot just has not fallen for him so far. Seems weird to give a C to someone who averages nearly 10 points, 3 assists, 4 boards, and over a steal per game. Since this grade is based on my preseason expectations, I could have just set the bar too high. If you had told me before the year how much time Brooks was going to miss, I definitely would have assumed that Melt would have been the guy to fill his shoes, step up, and shine. To me, that just hasn‚Äôt been the case so far this season.

**Santi Aldama - C**

It‚Äôs way too early to say much about Aldama. He‚Äôs really struggled to hit the three point shot in the NBA. There have been stretches where he shows some adeptness on either end of the floor and it gives you a little glimpse of why Kleiman and co. selected him last Summer. Big picture - it‚Äôs probably going to be 2-3 more years before we can tell what the Grizzlies have in Santi.

Doc Rivers and Frank Vogel were the most difficult to rank. Doc has been viewed as a good coach for a long time, but has never made it past the conference finals, and so far in Philly there isn't anything that would make me view him as a great coach. Frank Vogel has a championship. He also has LeBron. Hard to rank coaches when they have LeBron on their team. But I like his defensive schemes enough not to have him amongst the lowest ranked coaches (Most of whom are new). This brings me to my next point. If your team has a first year coach, it is really hard to rank a coach based on half a season of tenure, especially if this is their first head coaching job (Jamahl Mosley, Willie Green, Imo Udoka, etc.)",1642202572

Jerami Grant, Marcus Smart are names that come up for me. Jerami Grant is a versatile defender (not exclusively perimeter) and can do a lot of different things oftensively. Marcus Smart has had questions with his offensive fit next to the Jay‚Äôs and may be attainable. Joe Ingles will definitely have to go in this trade.  

Patrick Beverley seems to be comfortable in Minnesota but that brings into question Josh Okogie, a very good defender, who doesn‚Äôt have much of a role (due to his shaky offense).  

My last option would be Deanthony Melton from the Grizzlies, who is underrated as a defender, and has sunk in the rotation for the Grizzlies due to injury. The Grizzlies could look for some offensive firepower in the trade.

Mavs currently are struggling scoring the basketball and rank 25th in 3PT%. Mavs have Luka Doncic as their superstar player and while he hasn‚Äôt performed as well as his prior self, he‚Äôs still good for 25/8/8 any given season. I‚Äôm sure Luka would have no problem playing with Ben Simmons but the fit is an interesting one. 

Brunson is an UFA after this season and while the Mavs would love to keep Him I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs feasible. Sixers need a Pg desperately and I have a feeling Jalen would fit perfect alongside Embid. 

In Dallas, Simmons would ideally need to remodel his game and be able to stretch the floor while playing off ball with Luka. He would need to be a respectable outside shooter so that the spacing would be optimal. Running the pick and roll with Luka however wouldn‚Äôt be a huge problem and defensively I think he‚Äôd fit right in. Morey already has a relationship with Cuban and Dallas as they traded Richardson for Curry nearly 2 years ago. If Ben Simmons is interested in teaming up with Luka and Mark is dead set on finally acquiring an all star talent, then I could see a scenario where Philly and Dallas engage in trade talks.

Interesting piece from the The Ringer podcast yesterday where Kevin O'Connor &amp; Jonathan Tjarks are discussing possible landing spots for Myles Turner. Per there understand, Indiana is looking for Gordon Hayward in return if they are to land on a deal with Charlotte for Myles Turner.

Wanted to hear some thoughts on this from people. As a Hornets fan myself, I think it makes sense for the Hornets. It's pretty obvious how big of a role Hayward has on this team even without being the primary scoring option these days, but he Hornets have many upcoming players that need paid if they are to be retained (Miles, PJ, Martin) and this would free up a substantial amount of cap space for them looking forward and let them retain a few more younger players as well as give them the defensive anchor in the paint they've been looking for. 

Do you think this trade makes sense for both teams or would you be hesitant?",1642192777
1397,nba,the 90s were the golden age of the nba center. the 2000s were the golden age of the power forward. the 2010s were the golden age of the point guard. what will the 2020s be?,"I was tempted to say 2010s was golden age of the small forward since we have Durant and Lebron. Then it would be a pattern moving down in positions. But I think point guard is more accurate. 

90s had 4 of the top 10 centers of all time (Hakeem beat all of them in the playoffs from 1994-95 BTW)  - Hakeem, Shaq, David Robinson, and Ewing

2000s had 4 of the top 10 Power Forwards of all time: Duncan, Garnett, Nowitzki, Webber

2010s had 4 of the top 10-15 Point Guards of all time: Curry, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Lillard

2020s we have yet to see but everything points to it being a Platinum Age of the Center and Point Guard. 

Embiid and Jokic will be top 10 centers all time. KAT also has a chance to enter that conversation. Gobert helps add depth to the position. The center position has changed probably more than any position in the past 15 years, with new skills required and many centers whose skillsets were good in the 2000s have become obsolete. The new generation of young players that have grown up in this era and have grown up developing the current needed skillet are on their way, and we will have new dominant centers in the league soon who will go head to head with the guys I mentioned. 

Trae Young, Luka, and Ja Morant all have shown MVP level ability and the ability to lead a team in the playoffs and are 23, 22, and 22 years old respectively. Curry is still here in his prime and has been an MVP candidate the first two years of the 2020s.",1642192744

Full Quote:

&gt; I've heard Sacramento described by more than one rival team as the closest thing there is to a trade partner you could class as ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù to bring a resolution to the seemingly interminable Simmons standoff before the deadline (as things stand). Reason being: More than one rival team believes Sacramento, in its desire for a significant shakeup as it bumbles toward a record 16th consecutive season out of the playoffs, could be convinced to take on Tobias Harris' contract to facilitate a Simmons deal. If the Sixers can't get the top-flight player they covet, going ahead with a Simmons deal that enables them to shed the two years and nearly $80 million left on Harris' contract after this season might be too enticing to resist rather than holding out for a star in return.

&gt; Bear in mind that the Kings are in talks with numerous teams on numerous trade fronts and thus could proceed in a variety of directions. There is a rising belief around the league that Sacramento will indeed trade Barnes before this deadline after rebuffing all the interest he generated last season. The Pistons continue to be mentioned as a potential destination for Marvin Bagley III and Sacramento is likewise expected to trade Buddy Hield after nearly completing a deal in July that would have made Hield a Los Angeles Laker.",1642186044

1432,nba,[oc] mid-season all-underpaid teams.,"These rankings are based on the Spotrac valuation of contracts ( [NBA 2021 Valuation | Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/valuation/guard/) ) ; and consider a minimum of 25% of games played and 7 min per game. Teams consider 2 guards// 2 forwards // 1 center.

**1st team:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic // Miles Bridges, Domantas Sabonis // Nikola Jokic

**2nd team:** Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball // Giannis, Bobby Portis // Robert Williams III

**3rd team:** Dejounte Murray, SGA // LeBron James, Kevin Durant // Wendell Carter Jr.

Teams with All-Underpaid: (2) MIL, CHA ; (1) ATL, DAL, MEM, SAS, OKC, IND, LAL, BKN, DEN, BOS, ORL

This clearly shows the value of rookie contracts, and why spacing out first round picks to always have cheap contributors with controlled contracts is a great idea for contenders. Also, it is easy to see that Guards are the ones that need less time to develop and turn into the best contracts (in contrast to forwards that have a harder time). Also, Trae for Luka a WIN-WIN trade no doubts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Excluding rookie contracts:**

**1st team:** Dejounte Murray, Fred VanVleet // Domantas Sabonis, Giannis // Nikola Jokic

**2nd team:** Zach Lavine, Pat Connaughton // Bobby Portis, LeBron James // Joel Embiid

**3rd team:** Stephen Curry, Malik Monk // Kevin Durant , Montrezl Harrell// Jonas Valanciunas

Teams with All-Underpaid:  (3) MIL; (2) LAL; (1) SAS, TOR, CHI, GSW, WAS, IND, BKN, DEN, PHI, NOP

It is noteworthy that the team with more underpaid non-rookie contracts are precisely the last champions; which may be an explanation about how they are so good while not having a huge payroll (compared to other teams) and also not having a very strong 2nd option (unlike some other contenders). With respect to Centers, a notable missing player is Gobert, and he is 43 out of 54 C players in this valuation ranking, which is probably due to his HUGE contract.",1642184984

Lebron has to know that he's done winning rings at this point and it would be so goddam shrewd to bring in the only guy that would universally take the fall when they inevitably crap out again. 


Lebron is currently authoring a masterclass example of why NuMbErS don't tell the story.  The stats are incredible for any age, let alone 37 years old, but they aren't impacting winning one bit.  Lebron is always at his best when the pressure is off so I wouldn't be surprised if he calculated all this when they brought Russ in.  Russ is doing exactly what Russ does but everyone spends their energy talking about how Lebron's amazing and everyone else is the reason the team fails (another LeTrump quirk).


Much like the departed President, there are a lot of people who don't respect how Lebron ""earned"" his legacy but in the end you can't argue with a lot of the results.  My guess is he wanted cover to go chase the statistical side of things, get the scoring record, 40k/10k/10k, etc, without the pressure of actually trying to win.  Now he gets to mean mug after every pressure-less bucket to show ""how hard he's trying"" and act like an even more entitled jackass to everyone around him.

Im not gonna dive right into the stats and advance stats of Tyler vs the players people claim are ahead of him. Im not even going to say those players are underserving of the conversation. But one thing is clear, he is the heat‚Äôs go-to scorer with Jimmy out and many times when Jimmy is playing as well. Defenses know this and he almost always has the other teams best wing defenders on him. Now it‚Äôs well documented that the heat have had Jimmy and bam out most games but somehow they are still 2nd in the East. Now how can that be when the heats next best player is Lowry averaging 13 and 8 on 41%? Well it‚Äôs really been herro‚Äôs team and he is carrying the offensive burden. Now he is averaging 21 5 and 4. And one of the players I constantly hear get mentioned is Darius garland who is putting up 19 7 and 3. Kyrie has more votes than him lol. FVV is also carrying a huge burden offensively but is putting up 22 6 5, yet he is almost unanimously getting mentioned as a reserve with no one even opposing it.

All in all, I‚Äôm not claiming that these other players are not good or underserving with the exception of kyrie lol. But if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know yet herro is all that and then some for the heat. Also I literally only watch heat games and I watch them all. As they are the second team in the East as of now I thought I would share what he‚Äôs meant to us.",1642179507

As a limitation, this implies that the rankings are among active players and do not consider some others like John Wall, Ben Simmons or MPJ that are arguably the most overpaid players this season given their 0 production.

Teams consider 2 guards// 2 forwards // 1 center.

**1st team:** Garry Harris, Tomas Satoransky // Davis Bertans, Taurean Prince // Willie Cauley-Stein

**2nd team:** Joe Harris, Russell Westbrook // Aaron Nesmith, Jake Layman // Serge Ibaka

**3rd team:** Moses Moody, Leandro Bolmaro // Jonathan Kuminga, Danilo Gallinari // Tristan Thompson

&amp;#x200B;

As a note, it is interesting that two of the three rookie contract players are from GSW. It is probably due to the fact that they do not have a lot of opportunities/touches as it is a very deep team with championship aspirations.

Furthermore, this reflects some of the commonly known ""overpaid"" players as Gallinari, Westbrook and so on. CJ McCollum (158/182, actually better than Fox (160), Bogdanovic (161) or Fournier (172)), Tobias Harris (118/136) and Kevin Love (79/136) are also some players that are slightly less overpaid that what this sub thinks.

**Excluding rookie contracts:** 

Guards: Damian Lillard and D.J. Augustin jump to 3rd team

Forwards: Gallinari jumps to 2nd team, Reggie Bullock and Maurice Harkless jump to 3rd team.

It is interesting to see Lillard here. Maybe the injury? Maybe age is slowing him down? That potential extension looks risky.

He collects Zelda-related memorabilia; his favorite such piece, he says, might be his 3D printout of one particular shield.

&gt; Every time Allen scores, the Cavaliers' game operations staff plays a specific Zelda sound effect -- the jingle that (in the original) played when the protagonist uncovered some secret item or entry point. (Apparently that same sound -- or something very close to it -- has carried over into more recent Zelda iterations.)

&gt; That sound triggers a little hit of dopamine in my brain. I smile every time. It brings back the excitement of having discovered something new in that game -- once you blew in the cartridge enough times for it to load.

Purely no interaction other than fans cheering. Fucking nonsense, slapstick, bullshit sounds and outdated music need to go. Turn off the lights in the crowd and let the team play. Announcers only call time, players checking in and out, fouls, etc.   


2nd Option:  
Coordinated sound effects with crowds joining in.   
One example:

Whenever some goes for a dunk, the crowd can all say BOOM when their team gets it.   


Another example:

If one of the opposing teams goes to a shoot a 3, everyone gets real quick and right as he releases, screams at the top of their lungs.

Someone mentioned in the comment of the post game thread about how Steph's slump has lasted about 19/20 games about just *how bad* has it truly gotten. And so out of pure boredom and how funny I found it, I chose to compare him to this subs favorite spot up shooter, Russell Westbrook himself. I did some stuff for a comment because it's 6am, on the clock but no calls, and bored and thought it was funny personally how they compare and how funny stats can be messed with when using them in a certain way. With this, I decided this sub should see some of the results I found specifically about shooting and also some other stats at the end for fun just to compare the MVP Favorite to /r/NBA's favorite player.

#Last 15 games
***
So let's start simple and in Curry's favor with just the last 15 games, roughly about how long its been since Curry broke the 3 point record (Westbrook 14 games, Steph 13). For the 15 games going to go in depth on how comparing the two with the 19 games a lot more quick since some stuff doesn't need repeating. With that said, Westbrook has had a awful last few games even by his standards with a 3 single digit scoring games in a row on 19% so it should be heavily in Steph's favor right? Well lets start simple with just a straight up FG% comparison even tho it's a bad comparison:

* Steph: **39%**

* Westbrook: **42%**

Now this isn't that alarming despite just last year 48% to 44% in Curry's favor, but they take drastically different shots with Steph taking a lot more 3's so a small slump would put Curry below Westbrook despite both being in a slump. Concerning probably but alarming no but speaking of 3's, lets just have some fun and compare their 3p% the last 15 games (17 for Westbrook because he didn't attempt a 3 in 2 games):

* Steph: **32%**

* Westbrook: **49%**

Again, not the most surprising with Westbrook only taking 35 3's in the last 17 games (despite shooting 0% in 10 of his last 15 games where he attempted a 3) while Curry shot that many attempts in just his last 4. For shits and giggles tho: if just comparing the last 35 3's attempted of each it becomes **24% Curry, 49% Westbrook** but this is a even more unfair comparison because it's 4 games vs 17 just something found funny. 

Now, for a lot of people the most accurate way to compare shooting between two players especially with this vast different of playstyles is everyone's favorite stat, **true shooting percentage**. For a baseline comparison between these two players, last year Curry had a TS% of 65% to Westbrooks 50%, a 15% difference. This should tell us how big of a drop off or how far apart they still are in theory (sample sizes and what not yada yada) and for the sake of this post because of the two players I'm comparing, I thought would also be fair to also say the number for the calculations using [on this website that does it for me.](https://www.breakthroughbasketball.com/stats/tsp_calc.html)

* Steph: With 368 points, 303 FGA, and 78 FTA he has a **TS% of 54%**

* Westbrook: With 258 points, 222 FGA, and 82 FTA he has a **TS% of 50%**

A 4% difference is still a decent sized bit but is a lot smaller of a difference then it should be for that small of a sample size when in his last 3, Westbrook has made 8 shots on 40 attempts and 23 total points which is incredibly bad even by his standards. Also for fun (don't take this comparison serious, in fact don't take any of these serious) decided to remove these 3 games just to see the results for the 12 game sample size and it surprised me just how much it shot up all the way to 55%. Just a small fun bit thought was funny. 

So for the last 15 games we have a line of (FG/3p/TS):

* Steph: **39/32/54**

* Westbrook: **42/49/50**

In this sample size Steph has dropped 11% while Westbrook is shooting *overall* like his normal self (tho last 3 games are killing him), and bring Curry closer to shooting like Westbrook than just shooting like Lonzo Ball/Carmelo Anthony/Gordan Hayward, all of which he's shooting 4% worse then. 

#Last 20(19) games
***
Now lets get to the real meat of it, the last 19 games. About half of the current season played and about when many think his slump started (title said 20 but slump really is 19 but doesn't sound as good)

Going to keep it nice and simple here so to keep things consistent, here is their starting numbers for FG% and 3p% the last 19 games:

* Steph: **FG% is 37% and his 3p% is 31%**

* Westbrook: **FG% is 43% and his 3p% is 32%**

So for about the last half of the season, Westbrook FG% and 3P% wise (when attempting 2 or more in a game) has been shooting better then Steph. Again, different playstyles and different volume so lets head over again to true shooting percentage for the last 19 games:

* Steph: With 461 points, 388 FGA, and 98 FTA he has a **TS% of 53%**

* Westbrook: With 309 points, 281 FGA, and 64 FTA he has a **TS% of 50%**

For half of the season and increase the sample size, the true shooting % difference actually becomes even closer and this is *including* the awful stretch of Westbrook of the last 3 games. For those who care, removing just those 3 games brings Westbrook *above* Curry at **54% to 53%.** 

#Takeaways
***

So you might be asking, what should you take away from this? Nothing really, it's just funny how close they are combined with how the sub treats both players not even in general but just as shooters just for the last couple months despite how similar they are. **However**, what *should* be at least somewhat concerning if your a Warriors fan is that Westbrook, if you remove his last 3 games that are completely abnormal even by his standards with just 8 makes in 40 attempts with 23 points, and just replace them with the next 3 (so games 21-23 replacing 40-42) their comparison would be:

**(FG%/3p% when attempted 2+ in a game/TS%)**

* Steph: **37%/31%/53%**

* Westbrook: **48%/33%/53%**

This still including Westbrook having 2 single digit scoring games (1 more then Curry), 7 games shooting 0% from 3 even with 2+ attempts (obviously 7 more then Curry), and 3 games under 35% shooting (1 less then Curry). 

So with this, without the 3 games removed Curry in the last 19 games has barely been a better shooter then Westbrook and replacing the 3 games **Westbrook has been shooting the same if not *better* then Steph Curry himself.**

#Comparing some stats quickly for fun real quick
***

Before the tl;dr for people scrolling down, wanted to post some just random fun stat comparisons:

Box +/- (Wins/Losses/Overall):

* Steph: (+11/-7/+4)

* Westbrook: (+15/-10/+2)

Turnovers (Per Game/Overall):

* Steph: (3.7/69)

* Westbrook: (4/77)

Turnover Percent [Calculated through here](https://captaincalculator.com/sports/basketball/turnover-percentage/):

* Steph: 18%

* Westbrook: 19%

Efficiency [calculated by this](https://captaincalculator.com/sports/basketball/efficiency/) (Overall/Per Game/Per 48):

* Steph: 369/19/26

* Westbrook: 362/19/27

Near same box +/- (+4 to +2) which for how small the same size is huge considering the teams records in that time is Lakers (9-10) and Warriors (12-7) and their usage rates, near same turnover %, and Westbrook having the same per game EFF and a higher per 48 min EFF.

#Summary (kinda tl;dr)
***
In roughly little under the last half of the season so far, Westbrook is shooting at a similar TS% as Steph (53% to 50%) and when replacing Russ's uncharacteristic even by his standards last 3 games and replacing them with games 21-23 he is shooting at a **higher** TS% then Steph (54% to 53%), in the last 19 games without replacing the last 3 he has a similar box +/- (+4 to +2) despite a 3 win total difference in a small 19 game sample size, and the same per game PER at 19 with Westbrook having a higher per 48 minute PER (27 to 26). Not to mention a better assist to turnover ratio (Russ 2:1 Steph 1.5:1) and a near identical turnover rate of 19% and 18% respectfully. 


#(Extra) The MVP Race
***
As of the 14th of January, Curry leads the MVP race with +135 odds to win it. Westbrook in the last half of the season has the same if not higher TS%, better efficiency, same +/-, same turnover percentage, better assist:turnover ratio, more rebounds, assists, etc. all with no shooters on his team ~~including himself~~, and his co-stars in Lebron having only played in 30 games of the Lakers games and AD 27 however Russ has played in all 42 and kept them in the playoff race as the 7th seed and 2 games behind a top 5 seed. I'm not going to say anything about the MVP itself outside if Curry can still be the #1 after the last half of the season, why not Russ. 

***

If you were to tell Lakers fans Russ would be shooting like Steph, be more efficient then Steph, same turnovers as Steph, etc. you'd prob of got called a troll and banned of their subreddit yet here somehow we are. Aren't stats weird on just how easy they can be used to ~~somehow~~ back up stuff like this?",1642165360

1516,nba,"in the last 8 games, the warriors have the nba's worst offensive rating at 101.8. prior to the last 8 games, the warriors had the nba's 4th best offensive rating at 113.5.","In the last 8 games, the Warriors are:

\- 30th in Offensive Rating (101.8 ORTG)

\- 29th in PPG (100.6 PPG, ahead of Knicks)

\- 27th in FG% (43.1%, ahead of Pistons, Thunder, and Spurs)

\- 28th in 3PT% (31.8%, ahead of Nuggets and Nets)

\- 26th in FT% (72.2%, ahead of Hornets, Grizzlies, Cavaliers, and Knicks)

\- 26th in Turnovers (14.8, ahead Nuggets, Rockets, and Timberwolves)

Prior to the last 8 games, the Warriors were:

\- 4th in Offensive Rating (113.5 ORTG, behind Jazz, Hawks, and Hornets)

\- 4th in PPG (111.6 PPG, behind Jazz, Hornets, and Suns)

\- 4th in FG% (47.2%, behind Suns, Jazz, and Bulls)

\- 5th in 3PT% (36.7%, behind Bulls, Hawks, Hornets, and Heat)

\- 22nd in FT% (75.9%, ahead of Rockets, Lakers, Spurs, Hornets, Kings, Thunder, Grizzlies, and Bucks)

\- 28th in Turnovers (15.4, ahead of Rockets and Lakers)

The reason why the Warriors haven't lost more, you ask? The Warriors are 2nd in Defensive Rating in the last 8 games, and in fact have not surrendered the league's best Defensive Rating (throughout this season) since they played their 7th game.

1560,nba,are these really the best games tnt can put on?,"I guess in understand the warriors vs bucks- but can they not flex out the trailblazers out of all national games?? Especially when their star is out.  NBA needs to do something, I am an nba super fan and even outside of covid, we have had a slew of just horrible games and even more horrible scheduling.",1642137541
1561,nba,why isn't anthony edwards garnering all-star buzz like lamelo ball is?,"The second All-Star voting returns just came in and Lamelo Ball received nearly 700,000 votes, while Anthony Edwards barely has 1/3 of his votes at 220,000

Both of them are very exciting players in their own ways. Lamelo with his passes and Edward with his high flying dunks.

Lamelo Ball averages: 19.3 / 7.3 / 7.6 / 0.4 blks/ 1.6 stls

Shooting splits: 42.1 / 36.7 / 87.6

Anthony Edwards averages: 22.4 / 5.5 / 3.7 / 0.7 blks/ 1.6 stls

Shooting splits: 44.2 / 37.1 / 79.0

Yes, Anthony Edwards is shooting MORE and HITTING MORE 3s than Lamelo. He's taking 8.8 a game, compared to Lamelo's 7.3.

Antman's efg% and TS% are both better than Lamelo's. 
(53% efg + 55.7% TS) VS ( 50.2% efg + 53.7% TS)

Where Lamelo edges out is with his advanced statistics with Win-Shares, Box-plus-minue &amp; VORP.

[Lamelo's 1.9 OWS, 1.0 DWS, 2.8WS &amp; .119 WS/48 ]

[Anthony's 0.8 OWS, 1.4 DWS, 2.3 WS &amp; .088 WS/48 ]

Lamelo has a pretty high 3.8 BPM with 3.5 OBPM.

Edwards only has a 1.9 BPM, with 2.0 coming from OBPM and has a -0.1 on DBPM.

VORP also sees Lamelo as a more valuable player at 1.7 compared to Edwards 1.2.

Charlotte Hornets are actually above .500, with a 23-19 record right now which probably helps Lamelo's case, because the Timberwolves are fighting for a play-in spot with 20-22.

But overall, I can't tell why fans and media are so high on Lamelo, and doesn't even consider Anthony Edwards to have the same ceiling.",1642137074

1568,nba,"""40 wins before 20 losses"" - a measuring stick for contenders","This season has undoubtedly seen many teams shorthanded with health &amp; safety protocols. However, it is still interesting to evaluate where teams are at this point in the seasons when it comes to this rule of thumb.

If a team is not mentioned below, they already have 20 losses.

Incredible longshots - Hornets (23-19), Nuggets (20-19), Mavericks (22-19), Cavaliers (24-18), 76ers (23-17)

Need a huge win streak - Bucks (26-17), Heat (26-15)

Need to maintain season's pace, promising - Bulls (27-12), Nets (26-15), Jazz (28-14), Grizzlies (30-14)

Can go .500 and still make it - Suns (31-9), Warriors (30-10)

--------------

Now that Omicron has mostly swept through the rosters for the first and hopefully the last time, teams are finally returning to full strength, so the teams in ""decent chance"" and below should have at least a 50% chance of making it.

Warriors and Suns: Warriors have hit a rough patch lately, but they have a good margin for error. On the other hand, barring a sudden loss of form, the Suns should have no issue at all hitting this milestone.

Grizzlies: The Grizzlies' hot streak has been pretty well-publicized. They have gone 21-4 in their last 25 games and are making a run at the top spot after knocking off the Jazz for the 3 seed. Their roster is super deep (like seriously, they go like 12-deep in quality players and a promising Ziaire Williams is buried back there for now).

Jazz: Went 27-10 with Gobert and 1-4 without, they could certainly get their 12th win before their 6th loss provided Gobert comes back soon. The upcoming stretch of games does contain a brutal 7-game stretch against the Warriors, Suns, Suns, Grizzlies, Timberwolves, Nuggets, and Nets though.

Bulls and Nets: The Bulls and the Nets are the top teams in the East, and Brooklyn's Big 3 got the best of the Bulls in a 26-point drubbing yesterday. Still, both are leading the way in a surprisingly deep top 7 in the East.

Bucks: The Bucks have not been great lately, partially due to missing Jrue, BroLo, and George Hill, but it's certainly better than when they were out almost every starter at the beginning of the season. After starting 6-8 with rag-tag lineups, they have gone 20-9, so there's a universe where they make like the Grizz and go 14-2.

Heat: The Heat have been on fire lately too, going 10-4 in their last 14. They'll have to do better than that to hit 40 wins, but the Heat are no stranger to huge win streaks.",1642135491

Some other interesting points:

* Has shot less than 30% from 3pt range in 11 games
* Has had 4 games with 12 or fewer points and 8 games with 20 or fewer points.

What I don‚Äôt understand is why is this argument made to talk about Steph‚Äôs greatness? Tell me one all-time great that did not draw attention from multiple defenders, if not constantly double-teamed or even triple teamed.  Take prime Shaq for example, literally the only way teams could‚Äôve stopped him was double team when he is in the post and get the ball out of his hands. This is inside out basketball and just throwing it into Shaq and causing defenses to converge opened up so many opportunities for the rest of his teammates.  It‚Äôs not the exact same way as Steph but the concept of ‚Äúgravity‚Äù if I understand it correctly is applicable for so many other superstars today and all the greats from the past.  It may not ‚Äúlook‚Äù the same for each individual great player but the concept of creating easy opportunities for teammates is not anything new

Right now, i see them like the 2013 Warriors. Not there yet, just a lower seed, but soon, they will shake the basketball world.

And yes, i know weve been talking the same about wiggins and kat wolves in 2017,and all we got from that duo was one 1st round exit... but this time, i feell its diffrent. Ant is better than Wiggins was at that time, and i dont think Edwards will dissapoint like Wiggins did (no disrespect to Wiggins, he found himself a role in GSW, but hes still not a superstar like we expected). With Ant-man, i think he will live up to the hype, and lead the Twolves to succes, not necesserly a ring, but many Ws none the less",1642120213

Brandon had the short but sweet pleasure of balling with Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. His career ended at age 31 due to injury.

He leads the league over that span with 85 clutch field goals. For comparison, KD has 82, Bron has 78, Curry has 73 and DeRozan has 68.


Tatum played in 38 ‚Äúclutch‚Äù games, KD 35, Bron 30, Curry 37, and DeRozan 36.


Tatum has seen 10.6% of his shots come in the clutch over that span, Durant 11.4%, LeBron 12.5%, Curry 9.6%, and DeRozan 9.9%.


Tatum has a clutch eFG% of 45.9%, Durant 39.0%, LeBron 54.5%, Curry 50.0%, and DeRozan 64.0%. (That‚Äôs not a typo, Demar is insane)


Tatum also leads the league with 17 clutch shots in the 99th percentile of win probability impact. KD has 11, LeBron has 9, Curry has 11 and DeRozan has 10.


Of those high impact clutch shots, Tatum hits on an eFG% of 41.2%, Durant 50.0%, LeBron 33.3%, Curry 40.9%, and DeRozan at 40.0%.


Not shockingly, Durant and LeBron are both incredibly clutch. LeBron the best in the last 5 minutes, and KD the best with the biggest shots. Curry and Demar are also both great. Tatum is statistically and indisputably among the top 5 most clutch scorers in the game, and has a legitimate argument as the most clutch of anyone in the league. Not clutches player in general just yet, because of how good LeBron is from that aspect, and Durant as well. But if you need clutch buckets, Tatum is that guy.

&amp;#x200B;

He not only has good numbers cumulative numbers, he's extremely efficient from the field, like, Shaq levels of efficiency. His rebouding rate is also extremely high, especially his offensive rebounding rate(which separates the men from the boys), is as good as anyone in the league, and actually close to Moses Malone's who is the best offensive rebounder ever. Add to that his offensive rating to defensive rating differential is historically good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe he benefits from playing when games are not close and the competition that's on the court is not of very high quality. Still, it seems like he could at least be an excellent role player if he was playing 20-25 minutes per game.

PF: Adams
C: Gobert

As for a bench, whatever is the most average bench in the league obviously these guys aren‚Äôt playing 48 minutes.


Of course there are better fits but I think realistically a team could field this lineup salary-wise. The strategy is to have Derozan iso every single possession with the other 4 waiting to get the rebound like it‚Äôs a free throw attempt. My thinking here is that nearly every shot would result in either a bucket/offensive rebound followed by a put-back or a pass out. Also say this team gets a lead at any point in a quarter, Adams &amp; Gobert can put up ‚Äúshots‚Äù that purposely miss so the shot clock resets to 14 after every rebound. I know this wouldn‚Äôt happen realistically, but how would you counter this game-plan with the typical NBA roster? For one, I imagine defensively there would be leaks &amp; perimeter D is going to be an issue but I think this starting 5 would be capable enough to at the very least contest most shots with the massive advantage in wingspan. Plus the number of offensive rebounds that the opposing team gets would be drastically reduced. Free-throw shooting is not great but I don‚Äôt think any of the 5 shoot at a low enough rate to make it that exploitable. Am I a basketball genius or am I missing something?",1642115225

Made me wonder what would be the band that changed for the worse like the Lakers did by getting rid of popular members and bringing in a totally different star that didn't fit into the group at all and fans hated.

My pick would be Red Hot Chili Peppers when John Fruscante left after the massive success of Blood Sugar Sex Magic. Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was brought on as guitarist.  Band with great chemistry and success and a lesser known guitarist was replaced with a higher profile guitarist who was a completely different style (and not as good.)  RHCP album with Navarro ""Red Hot Minute"" is probably one of the worst received and lowest sale album that they ever released.

Lakers winning 2020 with a perfect chemistry (Lebron and AD as Kiedis/Flea) ditching Caruso (Fruscante) and replacing with Westbrook (Navarro).

Fans hated the change so much that Navarro almost immediately left and not long after Fruscante returned and Californication was released and outsold even BSSM.

\&gt;I have zero doubt that Westbrook is getting traded after this game and this was his final pout. There‚Äôs no chance he has this little self awareness.

\&gt;There‚Äôs $47m that comes off the books if you get him. It‚Äôs perfect for a team looking to tank.

\&gt;I honestly hate this man more than I‚Äôve hated Kwame Brown and Smush. I would trade him for the remains of Chris Mihms knees at this point.

\&gt;lakers have to trade russ for literally just anything, for wall at this point if that‚Äôs all they can get, end of third down 6 with just 30 seconds left he made that an 11 point game with an awful pull up three, and then turnover, both leading to fastbreak points

\&gt;There is genuinely no one who will trade for him. At least not without a bucket of picks, which the Lakers do not have.

These are some of the comments from [the Lakers and the Kings Post Game Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/s2ri4g/post_game_thread_the_sacramento_kings_1727_defeat/) and [the highlight of Westbrook pulling a triple down 4 with a minute left](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/s2rh9e/highlight_westbrook_pulls_the_triple_down_4_with/). I know, I know, the r/nba is too reactionary and it doesn't make too much sense to listen to these comments. Nevertheless, these comments got me thinking:

**Is it possible to trade Westbrook?**

To preface this, this whole thread is made under the assumption that the Lakers do decide to trade Westbrook. It could be argued that the best thing they can do at the moment is to keep Westbrook, wait for Davis to get healthy and then hope for the best.

But let's get back to the question whether it is possible to trade Westbrook. Some argue the only realistic trade would be trading for John Wall. However, in order to facilitate that move, the Lakers would probably have to include their 2025 FRP in the trade, which, to me, seems a bit rich for John Wall. Getting Wall is just treading water. It is playing Roulette, simply rolling the dice and hoping for the best. Which is what they did this summer by trading for Westbrook

If not Wall, then whom?  I‚Äôd argue it is impossible to get much in terms of positive assets considering Russel‚Äôs albatross contract and his inability to adapt to team needs.

I believe the only option is to trade him with the next season in mind, while, if possible, not sacrificing too much in terms of this season, and I believe I‚Äôve found a somewhat reasonable trade that enables the Lakers to do both.

It is not perfect. It doesn't fix all the Lakers' problems. It doesn't give too much to the trade partners, but I believe it might be a win-win-win trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The Los Angeles Lakers give: **Russel Westbrook**, 2027 **FRP**, 2023 **SRP**, 2025 **SRP**, 2028 **SRP** swap, **Kent Bazemore**
   * they get **Gary Harris**, **Robin Lopez**, **Justin Holiday**, and **Torrey Craig**. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The Orlando Magic give: **Gary Harris**, **Terrence Ross**, **Robin Lopez**
   * they get **Russel Westbrook, Kent Bazemore** and the **2027 FRP**

&amp;#x200B;

* The Indiana Pacers give: **Justin Holiday**, **Torrey Craig**
   * they get: **Terrence Ross**, 2023 **SRP**, 2025 SRP, 2028 SRP swap

**Why they do it?**

**The Lakers** get rid of Russell Westbrook. They have decided enough is enough, he just hasn't mashed with the other stars, he hasn't shown any signs of wanting to be what the Lakers need him to be, and he is on an albatross contract that debilitates the Lakers for two seasons. Yes, they do have to sacrifice a lot in terms of future. They give up the only FRP they can trade, they give up two additional second rounders and another second-round swap - and they don't get *that* much in return. But let's not forget that we are talking about the Lakers. They don't have to build through the draft. It is the single most appealing destination in the NBA. It is LA. It is the team that got Shaq and LeBron to sign with them. So they don't need the picks, they need cap space. By doing this trade, they are getting exactly that. By trading for two expiring contracts in Harris and Lopez, they save 33.3 million for the next season. That is a max contract. Truth be told, there aren't many attractive unrestricted agents this summer, other than LaVine who seems unlikely to sign with the Lakers. Still, there are interesting names that could make the team much stronger, deeper and that could turn the Lakers into a serious contender. To name a few: Ricky Rubio, Collin Sexton (restricted, but the Cavs might not match him, depending on the offer), Mitchell Robinson, Jusuf Nurkic, Robert Covington Thaddeus Young, Goran Dragic, Serge Ibaka, Dorian Finney-Smith. Since none of these guys are max-contract players, they could possibly sign two of them.

They also get help for this season. 

They need forward depth. They get Justin Holiday, who is both a reliable shooter and a defender, and is on a pretty cheap contract. They need a point-of-attack defense. They get Torrey Craig, who has the ability to slow down the Doncics and the Mitchells. They need shooting from somebody that can play defense. This applies to Justin Holiday, but even more so to Garry Harris, who has shown signs of life on the Magic in the past month, averaging almost 18 ppg on 46% from the field over 13 games. And they get Lopez, who is in the very least as useful as Dwight or Jordan as their five.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Magic** get a potentially very valuable first-round pick. For nothing of value. Gary Harris is an expiring, as well as is Lopez, and  Terrence Ross doesn't fit with the young core since he's 31. They get the 2027 first-round pick. 2027. That is more than five years from now and LeBron is 37. Davis is almost 29 and is injury prone. They have no young promising players. It could possibly be a top 10 or even a top 5 pick. They are rebuilding so they don't care that they have to pay Russel for one season, even if it's 45 million dollars. They can just do what the Rockets did with Wall and not take the ball away from their young guys, and if a desperate team turns up, they can, in a best-case-scenario, trade an expiring Westbrook for more future assets next season.

&amp;#x200B;

The reasoning for **the Pacers** is similar to the Magic. They give up Holiday, who is almost 33 and doesn't fit in the team's rebuilding plans, and same could be said for Craig who is 31. They get Terrence Ross, who has some value and they could either trade him to a contender in the future, when he is an expiring, or keep him if they trade LeVert or don't give another contract to Lamb or Warren, both of whom are on expiring contracts. And they get two second round picks, which could possibly be in the 30s, which is always a plus for a small-market team like the Pacers.

2x Suns

3x Warriors

3x Jazz

1x Nets

1x Heat

1x Bucks 

The &lt;.500 teams are as follows:

1x Magic (Lakers 1-0)

1x OKC (Lakers 1-2)

1x Pacers (Lakers OT Win)

1x Spurs (Lakers 2-1)

3x Pels (have not played each other yet)



They are 5-10 against &gt;.500 teams with Athony Davis who is currently out on injury which is more or less indefinite with a sprained MCL. 

They have had the easiest first half of schedule the entire season with an unprecedented 7-10 games at home to start their first 10 games going 3-7 to start the season. They are currently 21-21. And in sole possession of the 8th seed with Wolves 1 game behind them. 

Kings and Blazers who are just a little behind have significantly easier schedules. If they catch up, Lakers will be out of ***PLAY-IN*** contention. 

They have no assets (THT is not going to get you high quality return) and likely that no team will take Russel Westbrook as he is still owed $43m for this year and has a player option for next year he can opt in for another $44m. (Correct me if I'm wrong about this)

- 4.1 Turnovers
- 41/29/65 shooting splits, good for 48% TS (that‚Äôs 7% below the league average)

I don‚Äôt want to just pointlessly bring up his shortcomings, it‚Äôs just that after watching that game last night I really do struggle to think of a player who holds his team back on so many fronts when they‚Äôre having an off night. I watch Denver the most and we definitely have guys who challenge him on one or two fronts (facu, rivers etc), as I‚Äôm sure the vast majority of teams do. 

But when Russ is off he is:

- a *wildly* inefficient scorer
- not only turnover prone but also a straight up bad decision maker leading to plays that butcher the flow of the offense (including the tendency for hero ball down the stretch)
- often disengaged defensively (he seems to get a lot of momentum energy on that end  from playing well offensively)

He is a vortex of bad basketball traits when he‚Äôs like this, with the cherry on top being his insane price tag. What do you guys think? What is the path forward for LA? Would AD returning fix this? What do the playoffs look like for this team?",1642094619

Oladipo and Sabonis were traded one year later to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George. After the 18/19 season Jerami Grant was traded to the Nuggets for a first round pick and Paul George to the Clippers for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari and 5 first round picks and two pick-swaps. Galinari left one year later via a sign-and-trade to Atlanta for a second round pick.

&gt; In addition to persistent rumblings about the Hawks' efforts to move Cam Reddish for a future first-round pick, Atlanta's continued stumble out of the playoff picture has placed numerous roster shake-ups on the table for Travis Schlenk's front office. ‚ÄúEveryone but Trae Young and Clint Capela are available,‚Äù one assistant general manager told B/R. 
&gt; 
&gt; There remains a belief among rival front offices that the Hawks would be willing to part with De'Andre Hunter to bring a significant veteran contributor to Atlanta.
&gt; 
&gt; The Hawks appear fluid in their asking price for Reddish. Some teams have said Atlanta is looking for the draft capital mentioned above, but others have reported a desire to exchange Reddish for a veteran rotation wing on a value contract, or a younger first-round-caliber player whose rookie contract has more years remaining than Reddish's. 
&gt; 
&gt; Collins has a lot of fans around the league. San Antonio and Dallas have frequently been linked as suitors for some time. In a recent interview with Chris Kirschner of The Athletic, Collins said: ""Since I started conversations to get my contract last season, the trade conversations have been a thing that I've gotten used to. I pledged my allegiance to the city of Atlanta. I've never come in here once and pledged my allegiances elsewhere.""
&gt; 
&gt; Danilo Gallinari's name also started to circulate among league executives on Monday. His $20 million salary could serve as cap filler to pair with Reddish for a larger impact veteran. Only $5 million of Gallinari's salary is guaranteed for next season, the final of his three-year deal. Meanwhile, Solomon Hill, out for the season with a hamstring tear, is a strong trade candidate in order to open a roster spot.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There's some belief that Norman Powell would be open to a new destination. Negotiations over his five-year deal to re-sign in Portland this summer hit several snags, according to league sources, and Powell certainly eyed other destinations, such as New Orleans.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; John Wall seems entrenched in Houston with zero inclination to accept any type of buyout, sources said. And while Kevin Love entered this season open to trade scenarios, the veteran has played an integral reserve role during Cleveland's surprise season and has enjoyed the Cavaliers' new playoff-chasing environment, one source familiar with Love told B/R.
&gt; 
&gt; A team could stack contracts to match Harris' lofty number, but the more likely scenario has Simmons staying in Philadelphia past the deadline, short of a new trade candidate emerging. The 76ers do not view holding onto Simmons as punting on a season of Embiid's prime, a common criticism made by rival front offices. Philadelphia brass, sources told B/R, is still optimistic that Simmons may even be willing to return to game action in that event, although league personnel familiar with Simmons' side believe he has no interest in ever wearing a Sixers uniform again.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; Portland and Indiana seemed to be natural trade partners, two small-market teams underperforming based on preseason expectations but with a current shared goal of contending for the postseason. The Blazers had been frequently mentioned by league sources as a strong Myles Turner destination, while Detroit's Jerami Grant also emerged as a potential Portland target. But if Lillard is indefinitely sidelined, that would seem to further increase the likelihood of Jusuf Nurkic and Robert Covington heading elsewhere. 
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Caris LeVert has known suitors in Cleveland and New York, but so far Indiana has requested multiple first-round picks for the 27-year-old guard as well, sources said. The Pacers have also placed calls assessing the value of Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb and Torrey Craig.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; The Cavaliers don't project to be very aggressive in the coming weeks, but they will explore avenues to move Ricky Rubio and a protected first-rounder in an effort to net backcourt reinforcements, such as Eric Gordon, following Rubio and Collin Sexton's season-ending injuries.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; There's a strong possibility Dennis Schroder is traded ahead of the deadline. Boston is expected to avoid the tax and therefore likely won't be able to afford the point guard this offseason, which was also why the Celtics moved Daniel Theis to the Bulls last season. New York, Cleveland and Dallas have been mentioned as potential destinations for Schroder. 
&gt; 
&gt; Phoenix Suns big man Jalen Smith has been a recent trade target of Boston, according to league sources. There is a widespread belief the Celtics will be very active in efforts to bolster their roster around Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown in the coming weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; The Raptors' recent win streak has ended rivals' speculation Toronto could once again consider opting for a rebuild, as it did prior to the 2021 draft. Chris Boucher, in the final year of his contract, is considered available for a trade, however.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; Teams are circling Dorian Finney-Smith as a strong trade candidate in Dallas. Both Finney-Smith and Jalen Brunson will enter unrestricted free agency this summer, and the financial squeeze on the Mavericks will likely be too significant to retain both. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rick Carlisle was known as Finney-Smith's biggest advocate in Dallas, sources said, and Indiana has been mentioned as a potential destination. League personnel are also monitoring the possibility Dallas waives Willie Cauley-Stein to create a roster spot for Marquese Chriss, who is on his third 10-day deal with the team.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; The Hornets are facing a similar roster crunch this summer, and it appears P.J. Washington is a trade possibility for Charlotte. The Hornets, whose books are quickly approaching the tax, have some cap maneuvering ahead of them with Miles Bridges and Cody Martin's expiring contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Orlando is said to be asking for first-round picks in return for each of Terrence Ross, Gary Harris and Mo Bamba. Rival teams are optimistic those prices may drop to two second-rounders, as the Magic ultimately accepted for Evan Fournier last deadline.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; In Chicago, Coby White is believed to be available ahead of his impending rookie extension conversations this offseason. Drafted No. 7 in 2019, White is a holdover from the Bulls' previous front office regime.

&gt; 
&gt; And it spoke volumes.
&gt; 
&gt; It had been chippy the entire 2019 first-round series between the Trail Blazers and Oklahoma City Thunder, with Lillard and Russell Westbrook playing leading roles.
&gt; 
&gt; ""That was probably the most trash talk I've ever done in my life, like in the game, where we all was just kind of talking s--- to each other,"" Lillard said. ""Everybody on both teams. People was getting separated. People were saying stuff after the game in the media, stuff like that.""
&gt; 
&gt; The series didn't last long -- Lillard made sure of it. His 50th point in Game 5 came on a 37-footer over Paul George at the buzzer, one of the most iconic shots of this generation and one that sent the Thunder on vacation. Then as he walked off the court, he looked back and waved goodbye.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There are trash-talkers in the league,"" Lillard said, ""but in this era, it's more gestures.""
&gt; 
&gt; Lillard cited examples such as staring down the opposing bench after making a 3-pointer, Westbrook pretending to rock the baby after scoring on a post-up and Draymond Green flexing after an and-1.
&gt; 
&gt; Such gestures occasionally used to mock, as was the case in another trash-talking saga featuring Lillard and George. Lillard uncharacteristically missed a pair of free throws late in a loss to the LA Clippers in the 2020 bubble, and Patrick Beverley responded by animatedly tapping his wrist, literally rolling over in laughter while on the bench in street clothes.
&gt; 
&gt; Beverley did his best impersonation of the goodbye wave at the end of the game, with George joining in on the fun as their howling continued well after the final buzzer.
&gt; 
&gt; ""At that point, I was like, I'm gonna fire something back,"" Lillard said. He certainly has the receipts.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I mean, I hit a game winner in the playoffs to send [Beverley] home [in 2014], and I did the same thing to send [George] home. Maybe they're still upset about that.""

2) Westbrook and a 2025 1st for Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield. Lakers get back role players, Kings get a shorter contract allowing for more flexibility.

I believe total career points is an even more important record than points in the regular season alone. Playoff games are obviously more important and they account for a bigger part of a player's legacy than regular season alone. Some people argue that regular season is the only fair way to compare players, because players on bad teams are less likely to reach the playoffs. But the counter argument is that good players help their teams make the playoffs and their performance during the playoffs is a large part of their legacy and how we compare players.

At his age I‚Äôm not sure how many years he has left, and I haven‚Äôt watched much Rockets basketball, but I have to assume he‚Äôs turned into a catch and shoot threat. We‚Äôve also seen that the Rockets don‚Äôt seem to care about a veteran presence out on the court and would rather develop the young guys and acquire desirable picks. I really feel like Gordon gets traded at the deadline to a playoff team who‚Äôs missing this shooting talent.

Looking at current teams with playoff standings whose offenses are lacking the 3 ball game, there‚Äôs a couple places where Gordon makes sense but I‚Äôm not sure who has the best package to offer the rockets.

Brooklyn‚Äôs team stats from 3 are shockingly bad (16th in 3P% and 27th in 3PM) for a team who just acquired Patty Mills. They‚Äôd love Gordon but they have absolutely nothing to offer in return.

Philly is also lacking from 3 but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll be making any moves if they don‚Äôt involve Simmons. They do still have picks to give out however.

The Nuggets could look to bulk up their team further for the playoffs when Murray hopefully returns for the playoffs and Gordon would be a great option for Jokic to pass out to. If the rockets are willing to take a second round pick and a player such as Markus Howard or PJ Dozier maybe this happens? This would only occur if the Nuggets are really committing to a ‚Äúwin now‚Äù scheme (which I doubt, they may be more a win now team later on when/if MPJ returns to the court)

These are obviously all hypotheticals and there‚Äôs a world of possibilities for what could happen to Gordon. But what do you all think happens to him? What trade deal makes the most sense for Gordon and where can he move the needle the most?",1642083924

Do you think this would be a good fit? Or would someone like Goran Dragic or Malcolm Brogdon be a better fit?",1642080419
1899,nba,"the day lebron entered his prime: jan 09, 2009","This post is a few days late but I was watching old highlights and trawling BBR game logs and I came across this game:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_u_CguKCiU

Boston @ Cleveland, 1/09/2009.

Here's the boxscore:

https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200901090CLE.html

LeBron's statline: 38 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 4 steals, 3 blocks, 13/25 from the field, 3/7 from 3, 9/9 from the line (66% TS).

I remember watching this game live as a 14 year old at the time. I don't think I obviously quite grasped the nature of the moment at the time. I was (and obviously still am) a Laker fan and had tunnel vision for Kobe to win the MVP and for us to finally win another title.

This was the 2009 Celtics who were still mostly as good as the previous season. Garnett wasn't hurt yet. Their defense was suffocating. They did lose to us (the Lakers on Christmas), yes, and were going through a rough few games, but pretty much everyone at the time agreed that the title still ran through them no matter how well the Lakers and Cavs were playing.

I remember expecting the Celtics to come to the Q and make a statement game against the upstart Cavs to reassert themselves. I thought their championship pedigree would shine through again, like it did in the ECSF series the previous year.

Not to be. LeBron played what was honestly his best game of the season to that point and EVISCERATED the defending champions. Rewatching the highlights, it's easy to forget what a force of nature young LeBron was given how good he still is. Just look at how effortlessly he gets into the paint, against the vaunted Celtics defense led by KEVIN GARNETT.

What's even crazier is the impact on defense. He took the Celtics calling card and inverted it on them. He directly forced 7 turnovers and anchored a Cavs' defense that held the Cs to only 83 points and 12 points below their season Offensive Rating.

It might just be a regular season game that's easily forgotten, but when you look at the context, I really think this was the day that LeBron basically announced that he didn't care how good the Lakers or Celtics were, this was his league and he was going to will the Cavs to a title no matter how poor his teammates were (in the end it didn't work of course, and thankfully so considering we got it that year and the next, but not for lack of trying).

To me, when you look at the circumstances and the state of the league at the time, that was the game LeBron made LeLeap into the stratosphere he probably still hasn't left.",1642079784

1905,nba,do players from big urban areas have more flair to their game,"like DeRozan and Harden, they have the bag of moves. Even carmelo. from playing in a more competitive environment and streets, I don't know, it seems to be like this",1642079235
1906,nba,"we are just about halfway through the games played this year, how are you feeling about your team this far into the season?","Right now things are pretty good but could be a little better here in Knicks land. We currently have a near identical record to what we had at this point last season before trading for D Rose, with a pretty tough remaining schedule ahead of us. While Julius Randle's production has dipped to somewhat concerning levels, but lately he's been playing a bit more positive basketball even if the shot hasn't been falling well. He had a team high +28 against dallas last night despite a rough scoring performance. And if RJ can continue his scoring output or at least make it more of the norm, randle will get doubled less and should be able to have an easier time of the offensive end. 

Our trade deadline should be interesting, as we have a a decent amount of tradeable assets and promising young guys, but most of the fanbase would hate to see too many people leave beyond kemba, fournier, and noel, as this is kind of a transition year for us after overperforming and exceeding expectations last season. In simpler terms, we're not good enough to jeopardize chemistry for a shot at a deep playoff run, but we're definitely not looking to shut anyone down this season for the shot at a higher draft pick, as we have charlottes this year which just may convey at 19+ and dallas's next year which (salt and bias incoming) is just a ""Dallas gonna Dallas"" away from being a lottery pick

Our young guards continue to impress, to the point where im conviced we will have one of the best guard rotations in the league in a few years time. Quentin grimes and duece mcbride, while getting limited run, both show tremendous flashes of talent while quickley and rj are well on their way to becoming quality starters despite some rough outings here and there in a covid-fuckled season.

All in all, things are on the up and up, but if the knicks want to comfortably get into the playoffs they are going to need to condense their guard rotation, acquire a real small forward, hope d rose returns speedily and without too many growing pains in his return, and for obi to ideally be playing 18-22 minutes a game so randle can be a bit fresher in the 4th q and so taj gibsons career can play without fear of his hamstrings exploding. 

So whats good w ur team halfway through the season?

1920,nba,the lakers went down double digits in the 3rd quarter when russ was on the bench,"I am not a Westbrook fan, but I needed to see if Westbrook was the sole reason the Lakers lost to the Kings. 

The third quarter was pretty awful for the Lakers. They allowed the Kings to score 40 points. So I wondered how that happened. 

At 6 minutes in the third, the score was tied 79-79. The Lakers were up by 6 to start the third. At this point, Westbrook is subbed out and THT is put in. So the lineup is now THT, LeBron, Ariza, Monk and Bradley. 

At 4:54, the score is now 87-79 Kings, when Austin Reeves enters for Bradley. Lineup now THT, LeBron, Ariza, Monk, Reaves

At 3:45, the score is now 92-81 Kings, when Dwight Howard enters for Monk. Lineup now THT, LeBron, Ariza, Howard, Reaves

At 3:31 the score is now 93-82 Kings, when Westbrook reenters the game, replacing LeBron. Lineup now THT, Westbrook, Ariza, Howard, Reaves

At the end of the third, the score is 101-90 Kings before LeBron reenters to start the 4th. 

Westbrook made some poor decisions, and took some bad shots in the 4th, but there's a good 2 1/2 minute period in the third where Westbrook is on the bench and the Lakers go down 11 points. It's not all him causing problems in LA. It's everyone (except for LeBron. The dude is a beast).",1642072483

It‚Äôs not like Russ was going crazy from three that year either. Most of his points came strictly from the paint.

It wasn‚Äôt all small ball because he played well when Capela was there too.

And to top it all off, he had another dominant scorer in Harden next to him.

1948,nba,[oc] why the 76ers should focus on moving tobias harris into only okc's cap space before any simmons trade,"As of right now, Tobias Harris is being paid $35.9 mil/year and this number will only go higher the next 2 years. This is horrible for the 76ers because with 3 huge contracts (Simmons+Embiid+Tobias), they essentially have 0 roster flexibility outside of trades, vet mins, and other bargain contracts.

It goes without saying that Tobias Harris is a negative value to the 76ers at that contract. If they keep him, there roster for the next 3 years will be essentially the same minus whatever they get from the Simmons trade. It will also force their hand to overpay more players like they did with Tobias because they won't bee able to replace these players with their current cap space situation. They lose all negotiation power here.

That's why the 76ers should focus on moving Tobias Harris. At his current contract, that will probably cost them 2 first rounders. Up until this point in the post, you are probably going (No shit sherlock, thanks for stating the obvious). However, the emphasis of this post is they should **ONLY** trade him to OKC. See my reasoning below:

OKC currently has A LOT of open cap space. This means that the 76ers can trade him into the OKC cap space WITHOUT taking much salary back. You can play around with the trade machine but Muscula for Tobias Harris works. 

**Why do the 76ers want to do this?** 

By making this trade, the 76ers would get a $32.4 million Trade Exception that expires at the same time next year. This means that up until next year this time, the 76ers are able to use any assets they get from a Ben Simmons trade to trade for another player who is disgruntled or high quality making up to $32.4 mil (it can even be broken down too)

This move would also allow the 76ers to be under the cap for Free Agency 2022 (if they don't use trade exception by then), which would allow them to chase additional free agents and create more roster flexibility. 

This move also makes the Ben Simmons dilemma a bit easier for the 76ers too and decreases leverage other teams have. If the 76ers can get what they deem a suitable star for Simmons who makes similar money, then they will still have assets and pick swaps to pay for a 3rd star that fits into the TPE (they still own most of their picks and other teams 2nd rounders too). If the 76ers (Morey), think they can get a running-mate for Embiid in this year's free agency (maybe Harden because of Morey's hard-on?), then they can focus the Ben Simmons return around low salary, high-level role players + lots of picks&amp;swaps. This would allow them to throw those picks into the player they absorb with the TPE. This could lead to a roster of Embiid+FA signing+TPE player+high quality role players.

I think at Tobi's current contract, you have to attach 2 first round picks to get rid of him and maybe throw in a few second rounders to make Presti happy if that's what it takes to get things done.

**Why the 76ers don't do it?**

There is a high level of risk involved if things don't pan out. If you can't get an all-star caliber player with the TPE, you don't get the 3rd star.

You are wasting another year of prime Embiid.

They don't think they can get any quality players in free agency with new found cap space from Tobi (and maybe Simmons trade adds some too).",1642058243
1949,nba,trying to understand true shooting formula,"The formula for True Shooting is:

TS % = PTS / ( 2 \* (FGA + (0.44 \* FTA)))  


I'm having trouble understanding the benefit of an ""And 1"" (2pt shot) versus making both free throws. The key difference here is an ""And1"" counts as 1 FGA whereas 2 free throws off a 2pt shot attempt counts as 0 FGA.  


And1 (2pt shot) TS% = 3 / ( 2 \* (1 + (0.44 \* 1))) = 3 / 2.88 = 1.0417  
Making 2 free throws TS% = 2 / ( 2 \* (0 + (0.44 \* 2))) = 2 / 1.76 = 1.136  


So, technically making 2 free throws results in a higher TS% than getting fouled on a 2pt shot and making the basket.   


Am I missing something or does the formula not make sense since missing the shot after being fouled results in a better TS%?",1642058129

1991,nba,today espn revamped their ui for the nba website...,"Congraduations ESPN. You guys spent time and money to make your product worst. 

1. The new font is too thin. And because all the dates are in all caps. It's incredibly hard to read. You keep the team names in the old bold font. So now the left side is all chunky and the right side is thin and sparse. It's an eyesore.

2. The dates below the ""NBA Scoreboard"" use to be simple links. I don't know what you guys did. They're javascript now? You broke mouse gesture functionality.

3. Not to mention because of 2, there's now a loading time. As in before, when I click on another date, it loads instantly. Now I have to wait 2/3 secs. WTF?

&amp;nbsp;

Who asked for these changes? Wise man once said: ""If it aren't broke. Don't fix it"".",1642052967
