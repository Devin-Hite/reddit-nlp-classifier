The unsurprising final three shortlist and the deserving winner (Lewandowski) demonstrate that the jury selection process is nowhere near as corrupt or politicised, and is thus much more accurate.

Meanwhile, virtually every South American jury voter for the Ballon D‚Äôor boycotted Lewandowski by not including him in their top 5 at all. This, as well as the Ballon D‚Äôor failing to retrospectively award Lewandowski for 2020, despite the year of football still being played and Lewandowski winning all he could have won (top goal scorer, treble etc.), has caused significant disrepute to France Football in the eyes of many.

As it stands, the Ballon D‚Äôor is no longer reflective of the reality of the game played today and of the thoughtful opinions of serious football fans worldwide. Unless the voting (or jury selection) process changes and Lewandowski is redressed, I think we will see many start to boycott the event.",1642464282

65,soccer,"Real Madrid chews gum, raises its eyebrow, and lifts the trophy","**Real Madrid chews gum, raises its eyebrow, and lifts the trophy**

In a match which started tepidly and finished furiously, Real Madrid claimed its twelfth Supercup title. Athletic Club team was hopeful to lift the cup again twelve months later, but was unable to do what is currently needed to unsettle Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs team.

As the news pre-match developed through the weekend, those watching enjoyed a sweet moment between managers Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelino Garcia Toral. The manager from Asturias shared with Ancelotti a photo of a 1987 match in which, for a little under ten minutes, both shared the pitch in a UEFA Cup (now Europa League) match in Gijon.

Sporting Gijon measured up against none other than AC Milan, and what‚Äôs more, bested the Italian side, 1-0. 16,000 Sporting fans watched as its team put one over van Basten, Tassotti, Gullit and company. The second leg was sealed with a 3-0 win by AC Milan. Ultimately, the Asturianos could not hold Arrigo Sacchi‚Äôs side.¬†

On Sunday‚Äôs match to determine the winner between Blancos and Leones, the same expected result followed. The team favorite to win did so, and in a moment worthy of mention ‚Äìespecially these days‚Äì both Marcelino and Ancelotti hugged and smiled at each other at the end of it, recognizing the opposition‚Äôs effort.¬†

The match itself was not one to necessarily keep in your shortlist of matches of the season. Athletic Club set up with its usual 4-4-2, attempting to pressure up the field and not allowing Real Madrid to build from the back. When Real managed to do so, Marcelino kept two tight lines, ready to retrieve the ball and feed I√±aki Williams for the quick counter.¬†

Los Blancos showed the quality they have honed through the season to absorb that pressure, including Courtois as they passed through the first line and enjoyed the resulting space after that. In the few times Athletic armed a counter, Alaba particularly showed too strong and sharp for the older of the Williams brothers.

Through the first half, Athletic kept Real Madrid tamed, De Marcos and Berenguer more preoccupied in holding Vinicius than projecting up the pitch, and as a result, pushing Real to move on the right side. Rodrygo had more freedom than Vini last night, and Ancelotti‚Äôs team initially suffered through it, as the right winger is not as dangerous and positively chaotic as Vinicius.¬†

The crowd did not mind watching a slow first half. A sold-out King Fahd Stadium hosted 30,000 fans as they cheered ‚Äìunanimously for Real Madrid‚Äì and in one of those moments that only happens when neutral fans are present, inexplicably doing the wave with a scoreline of 0-0. Internationally-held Super Cup things.¬†

A few minutes after the wave, the score did change. Modric enabled Rodrygo on the right, with the Brazilian pushing the rival defense back with an incisive run, and passing back to the Croatian, who, on the inside edge of the box, released a Kroos-style curved shot into Unai Simon‚Äôs top left corner.¬†

A beautiful goal for Luka Modric who, at 36, continued to advocate for more playing time at the top level, and claimed his first goal of the season in the best possible scenario so far this season for Real Madrid.

Ultimately, Athletic paid for pressuring so high up the pitch when the opposition‚Äôs defense had the ball, and left a gap on midfield which Rodrygo and Modric took advantage of. The last few minutes of the first half ended with a close shot by Sancet, but overall, it left Marcelino leaving the bulk of the work to the second half.¬†

The manager took a page from the semifinal‚Äôs book, and put Nico Williams on to the pitch in the second half. The 19 year old was poised to revolutionize the match, as he had done against Atletico de Madrid, but the rival defense was on point against the young player, and overall, Athletic‚Äôs attack through the first hour of play.¬†

Real Madrid‚Äôs back four, and regardless of who is on the right ‚ÄìLucas Vazquez yesterday, as Carvajal was out with due to COVID‚Äì is extremely strong when Alaba, Militao, and Mendy are all in. The Brazilian center-back is especially reliable when Alaba is on the pitch with him; one of those cases of center backs made better by their teammate. Varane-Ramos. Albiol-Pau.¬†

Ten minutes into the first half, controversy was served when a potential handball inside of the box by Alaba meant VAR had to show the referee what had happened in slow motion (as per the book, it wasn‚Äôt a penalty). Five minutes into the second half, another handball was reviewed by the referee via the camera, but this one was to be called ‚ÄìBenzema‚Äôs shot hit Yeray‚Äôs stretched-out arm‚Äì and was executed by the French striker.¬†

Well-placed shot by Benzema, right of the goalkeeper, to which Unai Simon did not respond fast enough. The striker celebrated the second goal, and the goalkeeper smashed his bottle of water against the turf. Things were going exactly as Ancelotti wanted them to go, regardless of the way they played, and to whether they played to counter or keep possession.

The score read 2-0, and Marcelino made adjustments accordingly. Three changes, including Raul Garcia, meant Athletic had new blood on the pitch, and Real Madrid had to get Valverde out to counter that energy. The Uruguayan did wonders for Real and showed to be sharp and hungry for the ball. Modric and Kroos channeled their quality with the ball as they transitioned from defense to attack. Behind them, Casemiro played arguably his best match this month. But Athletic was getting closer.¬†

Ancelotti, on the sideline, fully accepted the situation as he often does. He saw the last 30 minutes as time for his team to not get overly tired and protect the win. Time went by as Raul Garcia, Muniain and the Williams brothers tried, to no avail.¬†

The dam broke in the last ten minutes, and the crowd was given a fitting finale to their week. Nico Williams orchestrated his first play worthy of mention, and almost connected with Raul Garcia. Marcelo came out to claim a place on the pitch, and contribute to what would be his 23rd trophy in all competitions with Real Madrid, tying him as a record-man with legendary player Paco Gento. And in a moment that left a lot of us scratching our heads, a shot impacted with Militao‚Äôs hand ‚Äì-not that uncommon‚Äì, and the referee, deeming it a clear scoring opportunity, showed the Brazilian the red card ‚Äìthis *was* surprising‚Äì. A chance for Athletic.

Everyone made plans for what the next few minutes of the match would look like, with Real Madrid ahead but with one less player. Courtois had other plans. The 6 7‚Äô‚Äô (201 cm) goalkeeper managed to save Raul Garcia‚Äôs penalty kick. Diving to his right, the Belgian kept his Cruyff-esque long legs close enough to the center of the goal to pull an acrobatic save that should be made into a poster by someone somewhere.¬†

That was the end of it. Marcelino put his head down, and Athletic with him. Real had done all the right things to lift the trophy, and the Basques, simply not enough to retain it. With a full sprint by Luke Modric in the 92nd minute to retrieve the ball as one of the last highlights, the match ended, and with it, started the celebrations.¬†

Marcelo, captain‚Äôs armband and trophy aimed at the sky, watched with his team as the confetti fell. Luka Modric was named man of the match, and Ancelotti was clear about the value of the Croatian in this team. ‚ÄúLuka‚Äôs form is deserving of a second Ballon d‚ÄôOr.‚Äù¬†

He also had words for the group as a whole as it claimed the first trophy of the season, the only one Ancelotti was missing in Spain; ‚ÄúWhen you win, you think you are the best, the most handsome. These players don‚Äôt believe any of that‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are not handsome, either,‚Äù he joked.¬†

Neither was the win, but with a practical, defensive at times and explosive at others, and in very Ancelotti fashion, Real Madrid chewed gum, raised its eyebrow, and lifted the trophy.¬†

666,soccer,To Clarify: Halaand has no release clause. But there is most likely a gentlemen's agreement between him and Borussia Dortmund.,"The majority of people still think that Halaand has a release clause in his contract for summer 2022. 

That's not the case.  BVB CEO Watzke already denied the existence of a release clause for Halaands contract for the summer 2022. 

He said that during the annual shareholder meeting in december.

Source: [https://www.sport.de/news/ne4720744/bvb-watzke-dementiert-ausstiegsklausel-bei-erling-haaland/](https://www.sport.de/news/ne4720744/bvb-watzke-dementiert-ausstiegsklausel-bei-erling-haaland/)

We do not know the exact details about his contract. But it isn't far-fetched that Dortmund has a bit more say than people are believing about halaands contract. Maybe Haaland has to stay if Dortmund offers a certain salary (Dortmund invest in their squad in this winter which was a surprise by many).

But that's just speculation. Why do people believe Haaland can leave for 75-90M?",1642346891

Ward-Prowse scores on a free kick every 1592 minutes played, while Beckham scored every 2291 minutes played. So, Ward-Prowse's free kick rate is 36% faster than Beckham's.

1786,soccer,New study: long covid impact in Bundesliga,"Team, 

There was a great read in latest Economist magazine on the long-term impact of covid infection of professional football players across Europe. Study is purely data driven and done by renown scientists. 

Take-aways: 
- even after full recovery, players do worse on a number of performance statistics. 

- this is a broad based trend, observable across many datapoints. 

- players played less minutes, still significantly lower 6 months following the infection. Also completed less passes and scored worse on more comprehensive measures of performance. 

My thoughts: 
If pro players with amazing access to health care suffer longterm consequences, this is quite a sobering outlook. I expect more of this data to appear the next months and years. 

Let‚Äôs hope our clubs, players and societies overall stay safe!
